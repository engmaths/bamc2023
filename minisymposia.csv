Advances in water waves and free-surface flows,"Jack Keeler, Alberto Alberello, Darren Crowdy, Phil Trinh, and Miles Wheeler","Advances in mathematical and numerical modelling of water waves and free-surface flows have benefitted applications in industry, marine engineering, and physical oceanography, amongst other fields. This minisymposia will focus on recent advances, in both pure and applied mathematics, and touch upon topics such as nonlinear wave-wave interactions, wave-structure interactions, wave interactions with complex bottom bathymetry, and viscous free-surface flows. Discussions on fundamental issues of vorticity, surface tension, instabilities, and geometry will also be central.",MON,All day,2Q42
Dynamics of reaction-transport systems,Andrew Krause and Nicolás Verschueren van Rees,"This minisymposium seeks to highlight exciting new breakthroughs and ideas in the broad area of dynamical systems and asymptotic techniques applied to reaction-transport systems. This includes pattern formation in nonlocal reaction-diffusion systems, the study of multistability and asymptotic behaviours, as well as some broad aspects of model selection and formulation. ",MON,All day,2Q49
Mechanics of hydrogels and poroelastic media,Matthew Hennessy and Matthew Butler,"Deformable porous solids that are filled with fluid appear in a wide range of natural and industrial contexts.  A key feature of these so-called poroelastic materials is the tight coupling between fluid and solid mechanics: fluid flow through the pore space can deform the solid matrix which, in turn, affects the flow.  Theoretically studying poroelastic materials opens the doors to a wide range of mathematical challenges including multi-physics and multi-scale modelling, model reduction and asymptotic techniques for nonlinear elasticity, instability and pattern formation, and large-scale numerical simulations.  The aim of this mini-symposium is highlight these challenges and the new physical insights that arise from overcoming them.  Particular attention will be paid to problems involving hydrogels, which are an important class of stimuli-responsive poroelastic materials that find use in soft robotics, regenerative medicine, and drug delivery.

"How to be better prepared for a future pandemic: lessons learned from COVID-19, mpox and the four historic influenza pandemics",Ben Swallow and Jasmina Panovska-Griffiths,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, mathematical and statistical modelling has been very useful in informing and advising policy decision making. Utilising existing methods across different disciplines and furnishing them with novel adaptations has been an important part of the pandemic response over the last three years. Additionally, new datasets have been collected in the UK and worldwide and used as part of the epidemic response. Combining these, highlighting the new knowledge and how to be better prepared for the new pandemic, is an important learning from COVID-19 and the previous four influenza pandemics. This minisimposium aims to untangle this marrying different epidemic response methods and data to illustrate how these have been useful and how we need to improve them in future.  
 
Within the minisymposium, we will explore the impact of Test-Trace-Isolate and different immunisation strategies against COVID-19, explore the role of progressive transmissibility of different SARS-CoV-2 variants in sustaining the COVID-19 pandemic and evaluate whether wastewater data can be a good indicator for pandemic surveillance. Additionally, we will discuss the key aspects that need to be considered to prevent a future influenza pandemic, discuss the factors that lead to winter pressures from seasonal influenza and how to control these and explore the role of closed and semi-closed populations (eg schools, workplaces, care-homw) in sustaining a growing epidemic.

Physiological flows and transport,Daniel Netherwood and Mariia Dvoriashyna,"The human body consists of about 60% fluids. These physiological fluids have many vital functions, among which are the maintenance of normal pressure levels (e.g. pressures in the eye and the brain), the transportation of oxygen, nutrients, and waste products (e.g. oxygen supply by blood, and clearance of metabolic waste by the lymphatic system), and the ability to provide liquid barriers and lubrication (e.g. tear film, mucus layer). Failure to adequately perform such functions can lead to many pathological conditions. The study of physiological fluid dynamics and transport is therefore not only relevant for our general understanding and interest in physiology, but also for the prevention and treatment of disease. Mathematical modelling has proven to be crucial in understanding and predicting the behaviour of physiological fluid flows and transport within various organs, such as the eye, brain, heart, ear, and lungs; as well as in tissue engineering. Whilst over the last 100 years, substantial efforts from the physical sciences have propelled our understanding of physiological fluid flow and transport, there is still a large variety of open problems that require a mathematician’s hand.

The modelling of problems related to physiological transport requires a variety of different mathematical techniques, including, but not limited to: deformation modelling, coupling fluid-structure interactions, elasticity theory, lubrication theory, poroelasticity theory, advection-diffusion systems, and homogenisation. In this mini-symposium, we will discuss some of the latest developments in the area of physiological fluid mechanics and transport in different organs, from the transport in the human placenta to microcirculation in the brain.

Controlling active matter,Anton Souslov and Ananyo Maitra,"Active matter refers to collections of living or synthetic constituents that turn ambient energy into mechanical work. As a complex far-from-equilibrium state, the descriptions of active matter at the single-particle, many-particle, and continuum levels require innovations in mathematical modelling. These models enable the control of biological and synthetic active materials and will allow us to design functional materials with specific well-controlled properties. This session will explore connections that will help build such theories of active matter and use these mathematical approaches to describe a variety of experimental systems.",MON,PM,2Q48
Mathematical pharmacology,Marcus Tindall and Filippo Menolascina,"Mathematical Pharmacology is a growing area of endeavour. Traditionally routed in describing the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of pharmaceutical compounds, it has more recently branched into understand multiscale drug action (from cells to whole cohort scales) via areas such as Quantitative Systems Pharmacology and Quantitative Systems Toxicology. This minisymposium will survey the field, providing examples from both industrial and academic perspectives.",MON,PM,2Q50/51
Mathematical and computational ophthalmology,Paul A Roberts,"Mathematical Ophthalmology concerns the use of mechanistic mathematical models (e.g. ODE/PDE models) to derive insight into the mechanisms underpinning the structure and function of the eye in health, development and disease and to predict the effects of existing and putative treatments. Computational Ophthalmology involves the application of advanced computational techniques, including artificial intelligence, to the big data being generated in ophthalmology, to identify pathology and predict disease progression. It is an exciting time in Mathematical and Computational Ophthalmology. Though a relatively small field, we are reaching a tipping point as the importance of quantitative tools in ophthalmology becomes more widely recognised and the number of those working in the field reaches a critical mass. Thus we are now at a point where a significant body of substantive research has been built up and where we are gaining increasing recognition as a community. In this minisymposium we will showcase research in the field to the broader Applied Mathematics community, and aim to build and strengthen connections and collaborations within the Mathematical and Computational Ophthalmology community. It is hoped that this session will also encourage other applied mathematicians to conduct research in this exciting area.",MON,PM,4Q56
Multiple wave scattering,"Matthew Nethercote, Kevish Napal, Artur Gower, Raphael Assier, and I. David Abrahams","Multiple wave scattering is a vibrant and expanding research area of interest to mathematicians, physicists, engineers and others concerned with the properties of waves in complex materials. The mathematical theory has a long history and was studied by luminaries of 19th-century science, such as Maxwell and Rayleigh. A sound understanding of the field is essential to deliver the potential transformative innovations beyond the realm of sci-fi that can be achieved by manipulating wave behaviour, such as invisibility cloaks, noise cancellation, imaging living cells, and many more. These can be useful in a wide range of applications, including but not limited to; medical imaging, electromagnetics, acoustics, elasticity, water wave mechanics, metamaterial design, atmospheric imaging, etc. Despite the wide range of these applications, there are many similarities, from the methods and techniques used for all these different problems, to fundamental mathematics at their core. Contemporary mathematical challenges are extensive, ranging from design of metamaterials to numerical difficulties associated with massive scattering simulations. 

A large part of the global community that is working on multiple wave scattering will be attending a programme dedicated to this topic at the Isaac Newton Institute at Cambridge University during the first six months of 2023. The proposed minisymposium will be a great opportunity to bring the programme participants to promote this topic as it shall allow them to showcase their research on multiple wave scattering through different types of talks and give a broad overview of this field and its various applications. Furthermore, it would allow this community to meet researchers of other disciplines at the BAMC in order to create new collaborations and exchange state-of-the-art methodologies and approaches.",TUE,All day,4Q05
Mathematical modelling in sport,Graham Patrick Benham,"This minisymposium will cover some ongoing areas of research in the mathematical modelling of different sports.

I have provisional confirmation from 5 speakers plus myself, fulfilling the necessary quota. ",TUE,AM,2Q42
Advances in applied numerical linear algebra and its applications,Malena Sabaté Landman and Ander Biguri,"Many applications in scientific computing and engineering involve solving large-scale linear systems and usually rely in readily-available numerical linear algebra tools. However, modern applications might involve more complex and specific needs (e.g. the use of particular matrix structures or the need for specific regularization), making the optimization problems more challenging and calling for new algorithm developments. 

This minisymposium focuses both on recent algorithmic advances for solving large-scale linear systems as well as real-life applications, in an attempt to bringing together different perspectives and providing a space to exchange ideas and highlight new challenges in the areas of iterative methods, regularization and machine learning. ",TUE,AM,2Q48
Neurodynamics,Kyle Wedgwood and Stephen Coombes,"Neurodynamics employs techniques from dynamical systems theory, including bifurcation theory, weakly nonlinear analysis and numerical simulation, to explore the principles by which single neurons generate action potentials (spikes) and synaptic networks generate electrical waves and patterns fundamental for neurobiological function. In this minisymposium, speakers will present on a range of topics including the analysis and control of neuronal oscillations and the propagation of neuronal activity (travelling waves). Mathematical theory will be applied to understand neuronal (patho)physiology, including auditory processing and the brain dynamics associated with epilepsy.",TUE,AM,2Q50/51
Chemo-mechanical couplings in growing tissues,Alexander Erlich,"The functioning of living soft tissues is influenced by a complex interplay of biological, chemical, and mechanical factors. Researchers in fields such as biomechanics, biophysics, and medical engineering have been working to understand these coupling mechanisms and their implications. In this mini-symposium, we review some of the most recent of chemo-mechanical coupling theories for soft biological tissues (e.g., tumors, the cardiovascular and physiological system, nerves) and organoids. The work presented here will show mathematical frameworks capable of capturing intricate multiphysics couplings between growth, finite elasticity, reaction-diffusion systems on growing domains. ",TUE,AM,4Q56
Sea ice modelling,Brian Wetton,"Sea Ice has mathematical challenges on a wide range of time and space scales with  important applications in biology and climate science. At small scales, there is a need to understand the impact of entropy and externally imposed thermal gradients on the shape of brine inclusions in first-year sea ice. There are computational issues to be resolved for intermediate scales of ice formation including the dynamics of mushy layers. At large scales, statistical and machine learning techniques can be used to model sea ice thickness and distribution. Homogenization of small scale structures to large scale behaviour and the inverse problem of inferring small scale behaviour from large scale data is of interest. The session will start with an overview talk. ",TUE,PM,2Q42

Modelling and inference in public health,Eduard Campillo-Funollet and James van Yperen,"Mathematical models are prominent in public health services and healthcare. Examples include queueing models, nowcasting and forecasting for demand and capacity planning, systems modelling, and vaccination strategies for epidemiology, but also studies data analysis for diagnostics and treatment efficacy. In this minisymposium, we will focus on derivation of models used in public health and healthcare, how they incorporate available data and different types of uses.
To provide robust and reliable outcomes, we calibrate models with the available data, for instance to model a local population or individual patients. However, estimating model parameters is often challenging, posing problems at the interface between applied mathematics and statistics. As well as novel models, we look to explore different methods that researchers have used to overcome this barrier, the use of statistical methods for missing data and data integration.",TUE,PM,2Q50/51
New mathematical approaches in the life sciences,"Rachel Bennett, Alex Mietke, and Ryan Palmer","From micro to macro-scales, living systems present some of the most fascinating phenomena around us. Many recent developments at the interface of biology and physics have arisen from multi-disciplinary research in which mathematics has played a crucial role. In this minisymposium, we provide a platform for emerging topics that have recently gained traction in mathematical biology. The biological themes covered by the speakers include wound healing, the structure of viruses, modern population dynamics, and sensory biology.
 
In addressing these problems, the speakers will highlight ideas from applied mathematics that extend the traditional remit of mathematical biology exploiting the latest developments in fields such as collective dynamics, group theory, micro-fluidics, geometry, PDE theory, machine learning and electrostatics. Together these topics indicate how a wide arsenal of mathematical methods are required to understand the living world. The broader context and impact of the presented topics will also be visited including: insights for health care and medical research, new perspectives on the ecological impact of human activity, ideas for bio-inspired technological and more.

Mathematical modelling of sleep and circadian rhythms: from molecular mechanisms to policy,Jake Ahern and Anne Skeldon,"Intrinsic near 24-hour oscillations – so-called circadian rhythms (“circa” for about, “dian” for day) - are found in all forms of life and evolved as a response to the environmental cycle of light-dark determined by the daily rotation of the Earth. These near 24-hour oscillations are present in nearly every cell and regulate many aspects of life from gene function and cell-signalling to physiology and behaviour, including the sleep-wake cycle. In humans, disrupted rhythms are associated with major chronic health conditions including heart disease, some cancers and dementia, and many aspects of our day-to-day function including mood, performance and pain perception.

This minisymposium will be at the intersection of physiology and mathematics as we explore recent developments in circadian and sleep modelling across different species. A multidisciplinary team of scientists will present experimental data and mathematical models, highlighting the symbiotic nature of the two approaches. Mathematical models will range from conceptual phase models to large-scale simulations to investigate the internal mechanisms of circadian rhythms and their external interactions. In addition, recent mathematical methods to determine circadian time will also be presented. This minisymposium aims to deepen our understanding of circadian rhythms from the molecular level to their influence on human health and policy.  ",WED,AM,2Q42
Optimisation and control for nonlinear dynamics,Susana Gomes and Dante Kalise,"Nonlinear dynamics are ubiquitous in mathematical modelling, arising in multi-agent systems, fluid flows, and underactuated robotics, among many others. The solution of optimisation and control problems constrained to nonlinear evolution equations poses both theoretical and computational challenges. This minisyposium aims at discussing recent results by early career researchers on the synthesis of control laws for nonlinear systems
including stabilisation in fluid flow problems, optimal control of agent-based dynamics, and data-driven approaches.",WED,AM,2Q48
Networks and complex systems in society,"Dan Catlin, Jonathan Ward, and David Lloyd","Our everyday lives involve a myriad of interactions with other people, which collectively can give rise to interesting and important phenomena, ranging from traffic on motorways to polarisation of public opinion, stock market crashes and the spread of epidemics. Mathematical modelling can provide important insights into how individual behaviours and interactions impact large-scale phenomena, and such problems are the focus of the network science and complex systems disciplines. In this mini-symposium, early career researchers will present their research from the forefront of mathematical modelling of social systems using network science and complex systems techniques.",WED,AM,2Q49
Metamaterial modelling and design,Bryn Davies and Stefan Szyniszewski,"This session is organised by the UK Metamaterials Network, to showcase the mathematical techniques underpinning recent breakthroughs in metamaterials science. The talks will illustrate a variety of the current methods and the challenges that remain. This minisymposium will demonstrate the ubiquity of mathematical techniques by bringing together researchers from different physical regimes, including electromagnetism, acoustics and mechanics. The aim is to promote the exchange of ideas and knowledge between the different application areas.",WED,AM,4Q05
Asymptotics in active matter,Benjamin Walker,"In active matter, phenomena on the macroscale (in either time, space, or sometimes both) are often driven by behaviours that occur on the microscale. A striking example of such a macroscale behaviour is the surprising formation of turbulent patterns in dense suspensions of motile bacteria, which emerge from the accumulation of many small-scale effects. We can even find multiscale behaviours occurring at the level of a single active body, with many shape-changing swimmers undergoing rapid deformations that, on average, give rise to progression that only occurs over a significantly longer timescale.

In this minisymposium, we will focus on how asymptotic methods can be used to exploit the disparity in scales present in many active matter systems. In particular, we will showcase how various asymptotic approaches have been used to yield insights into emergent, macroscale dynamics through systematic analysis. In doing so, we will explore recent developments in a broad selection of active systems, including active droplets, microswimmers in flows, and quorum-sensing bacterial suspensions.",WED,AM,4Q56
