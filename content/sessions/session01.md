# Advances in water waves and free-surface flows

**Organisers:** Jack Keeler, Alberto Alberello, Darren Crowdy, Phil Trinh, and Miles Wheeler

**Minisymposium abstract**

Advances in mathematical and numerical modelling of water waves and free-surface flows have benefitted applications in industry, marine engineering, and physical oceanography, amongst other fields. This minisymposia will focus on recent advances, in both pure and applied mathematics, and touch upon topics such as nonlinear wave-wave interactions, wave-structure interactions, wave interactions with complex bottom bathymetry, and viscous free-surface flows. Discussions on fundamental issues of vorticity, surface tension, instabilities, and geometry will also be central.
