# Multiple wave scattering

**Organisers:** Matthew Nethercote, Kevish Napal, Artur Gower, Raphael Assier, and I. David Abrahams

**Minisymposium abstract**

Multiple wave scattering is a vibrant and expanding research area of interest to mathematicians, physicists, engineers and others concerned with the properties of waves in complex materials. The mathematical theory has a long history and was studied by luminaries of 19th-century science, such as Maxwell and Rayleigh. A sound understanding of the field is essential to deliver the potential transformative innovations beyond the realm of sci-fi that can be achieved by manipulating wave behaviour, such as invisibility cloaks, noise cancellation, imaging living cells, and many more. These can be useful in a wide range of applications, including but not limited to; medical imaging, electromagnetics, acoustics, elasticity, water wave mechanics, metamaterial design, atmospheric imaging, etc. Despite the wide range of these applications, there are many similarities, from the methods and techniques used for all these different problems, to fundamental mathematics at their core. Contemporary mathematical challenges are extensive, ranging from design of metamaterials to numerical difficulties associated with massive scattering simulations. 

A large part of the global community that is working on multiple wave scattering will be attending a programme dedicated to this topic at the Isaac Newton Institute at Cambridge University during the first six months of 2023. The proposed minisymposium will be a great opportunity to bring the programme participants to promote this topic as it shall allow them to showcase their research on multiple wave scattering through different types of talks and give a broad overview of this field and its various applications. Furthermore, it would allow this community to meet researchers of other disciplines at the BAMC in order to create new collaborations and exchange state-of-the-art methodologies and approaches.
