# IMA Lighthill-Thwaites prize

**Organisers:** Institute of Mathematics and its Applications

**Minisymposium abstract**

The IMA Lighthill-Thwaites prize is a biennial prize established by the IMA in recognition of the achievement of its first two Presidents – Professors Sir James Lighthill and Sir Bryan Thwaites – in laying the foundations of what has become a major scientific institute. It was their mutual interest in the education and training of young people, as much as their involvement in applied mathematics, that has shaped the conditions of the prize. The award is based on a submitted piece of work that describes an aspect of a candidate's original research in any area of the application of mathematics and is suitable for presentation at the BAMC. All candidates have spent no more than five years in further study or full-time equivalent since commencing their (first) PhD and the shortlisted candidates (designated "finalists") present their papers in a special session of the BAMC. In 2022/2023, the quality of submissions was so high that eight candidates have been selected to present their work as finalists in the IMA Lighthill-Thwaites prize. More details about the prize (including previous winners) can be found at https://ima.org.uk/awards-medals/ima-lighthill-thwaites-prize/
