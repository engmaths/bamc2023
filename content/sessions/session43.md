# Optimisation and control for nonlinear dynamics

**Organisers:** Susana Gomes and Dante Kalise

**Minisymposium abstract**

Nonlinear dynamics are ubiquitous in mathematical modelling, arising in multi-agent systems, fluid flows, and underactuated robotics, among many others. The solution of optimisation and control problems constrained to nonlinear evolution equations poses both theoretical and computational challenges. This minisyposium aims at discussing recent results by early career researchers on the synthesis of control laws for nonlinear systems
including stabilisation in fluid flow problems, optimal control of agent-based dynamics, and data-driven approaches.
