# Mathematical and computational ophthalmology

**Organisers:** Paul A Roberts

**Minisymposium abstract**

Mathematical Ophthalmology concerns the use of mechanistic mathematical models (e.g. ODE/PDE models) to derive insight into the mechanisms underpinning the structure and function of the eye in health, development and disease and to predict the effects of existing and putative treatments. Computational Ophthalmology involves the application of advanced computational techniques, including artificial intelligence, to the big data being generated in ophthalmology, to identify pathology and predict disease progression. It is an exciting time in Mathematical and Computational Ophthalmology. Though a relatively small field, we are reaching a tipping point as the importance of quantitative tools in ophthalmology becomes more widely recognised and the number of those working in the field reaches a critical mass. Thus we are now at a point where a significant body of substantive research has been built up and where we are gaining increasing recognition as a community. In this minisymposium we will showcase research in the field to the broader Applied Mathematics community, and aim to build and strengthen connections and collaborations within the Mathematical and Computational Ophthalmology community. It is hoped that this session will also encourage other applied mathematicians to conduct research in this exciting area.
