# Dynamics of reaction-transport systems

**Organisers:** Andrew Krause and Nicolás Verschueren van Rees

**Minisymposium abstract**

This minisymposium seeks to highlight exciting new breakthroughs and ideas in the broad area of dynamical systems and asymptotic techniques applied to reaction-transport systems. This includes pattern formation in nonlocal reaction-diffusion systems, the study of multistability and asymptotic behaviours, as well as some broad aspects of model selection and formulation.
