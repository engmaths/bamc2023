# Modelling and inference in public health

**Organisers:** Eduard Campillo-Funollet and James van Yperen

**Minisymposium abstract**

Mathematical models are prominent in public health services and healthcare. Examples include queueing models, nowcasting and forecasting for demand and capacity planning, systems modelling, and vaccination strategies for epidemiology, but also studies data analysis for diagnostics and treatment efficacy. In this minisymposium, we will focus on derivation of models used in public health and healthcare, how they incorporate available data and different types of uses.
To provide robust and reliable outcomes, we calibrate models with the available data, for instance to model a local population or individual patients. However, estimating model parameters is often challenging, posing problems at the interface between applied mathematics and statistics. As well as novel models, we look to explore different methods that researchers have used to overcome this barrier, the use of statistical methods for missing data and data integration.
