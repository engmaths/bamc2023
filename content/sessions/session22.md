# Advances in applied numerical linear algebra and its applications

**Organisers:** Malena Sabaté Landman and Ander Biguri

**Minisymposium abstract**

Many applications in scientific computing and engineering involve solving large-scale linear systems and usually rely in readily-available numerical linear algebra tools. However, modern applications might involve more complex and specific needs (e.g. the use of particular matrix structures or the need for specific regularization), making the optimization problems more challenging and calling for new algorithm developments. 

This minisymposium focuses both on recent algorithmic advances for solving large-scale linear systems as well as real-life applications, in an attempt to bringing together different perspectives and providing a space to exchange ideas and highlight new challenges in the areas of iterative methods, regularization and machine learning.
