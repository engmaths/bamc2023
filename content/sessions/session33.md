# Sea ice modelling

**Organisers:** Brian Wetton

**Minisymposium abstract**

Sea Ice has mathematical challenges on a wide range of time and space scales with  important applications in biology and climate science. At small scales, there is a need to understand the impact of entropy and externally imposed thermal gradients on the shape of brine inclusions in first-year sea ice. There are computational issues to be resolved for intermediate scales of ice formation including the dynamics of mushy layers. At large scales, statistical and machine learning techniques can be used to model sea ice thickness and distribution. Homogenization of small scale structures to large scale behaviour and the inverse problem of inferring small scale behaviour from large scale data is of interest. The session will start with an overview talk.
