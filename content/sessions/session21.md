# Mathematical modelling in sport

**Organisers:** Graham Patrick Benham

**Minisymposium abstract**

This minisymposium will cover some ongoing areas of research in the mathematical modelling of different sports. The talks will survey research in improving the performance and technique for competitive sports, including applications to industry and collaborations with athletes/trainers. I have provisional confirmation from 5 speakers plus myself, fulfilling the necessary quota.
