# Mathematical pharmacology

**Organisers:** Marcus Tindall and Filippo Menolascina

**Minisymposium abstract**

Mathematical Pharmacology is a growing area of endeavour. Traditionally routed in describing the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of pharmaceutical compounds, it has more recently branched into understand multiscale drug action (from cells to whole cohort scales) via areas such as Quantitative Systems Pharmacology and Quantitative Systems Toxicology. This minisymposium will survey the field, providing examples from both industrial and academic perspectives.
