# Chemo-mechanical couplings in growing tissues

**Organisers:** Alexander Erlich

**Minisymposium abstract**

The functioning of living soft tissues is influenced by a complex interplay of biological, chemical, and mechanical factors. Researchers in fields such as biomechanics, biophysics, and medical engineering have been working to understand these coupling mechanisms and their implications. In this mini-symposium, we review some of the most recent of chemo-mechanical coupling theories for soft biological tissues (e.g., tumors, the cardiovascular and physiological system, nerves) and organoids. The work presented here will show mathematical frameworks capable of capturing intricate multiphysics couplings between growth, finite elasticity, reaction-diffusion systems on growing domains.
