# Neurodynamics

**Organisers:** Kyle Wedgwood and Stephen Coombes

**Minisymposium abstract**

Neurodynamics employs techniques from dynamical systems theory, including bifurcation theory, weakly nonlinear analysis and numerical simulation, to explore the principles by which single neurons generate action potentials (spikes) and synaptic networks generate electrical waves and patterns fundamental for neurobiological function. In this minisymposium, speakers will present on a range of topics including the analysis and control of neuronal oscillations and the propagation of neuronal activity (travelling waves). Mathematical theory will be applied to understand neuronal (patho)physiology, including auditory processing and the brain dynamics associated with epilepsy.
