# Metamaterial modelling and design

**Organisers:** Bryn Davies and Stefan Szyniszewski

**Minisymposium abstract**

This session is organised by the UK Metamaterials Network, to showcase the mathematical techniques underpinning recent breakthroughs in metamaterials science. The talks will illustrate a variety of the current methods and the challenges that remain. This minisymposium will demonstrate the ubiquity of mathematical techniques by bringing together researchers from different physical regimes, including electromagnetism, acoustics and mechanics. The aim is to promote the exchange of ideas and knowledge between the different application areas.
