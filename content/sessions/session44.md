# Networks and complex systems in society

**Organisers:** Dan Catlin, Jonathan Ward, and David Lloyd

**Minisymposium abstract**

Our everyday lives involve a myriad of interactions with other people, which collectively can give rise to interesting and important phenomena, ranging from traffic on motorways to polarisation of public opinion, stock market crashes and the spread of epidemics. Mathematical modelling can provide important insights into how individual behaviours and interactions impact large-scale phenomena, and such problems are the focus of the network science and complex systems disciplines. In this mini-symposium, early career researchers will present their research from the forefront of mathematical modelling of social systems using network science and complex systems techniques.
