# Mathematical modelling of sleep and circadian rhythms: from molecular mechanisms to policy

**Organisers:** Jake Ahern and Anne Skeldon

**Minisymposium abstract**

Intrinsic near 24-hour oscillations – so-called circadian rhythms (“circa” for about, “dian” for day) - are found in all forms of life and evolved as a response to the environmental cycle of light-dark determined by the daily rotation of the Earth. These near 24-hour oscillations are present in nearly every cell and regulate many aspects of life from gene function and cell-signalling to physiology and behaviour, including the sleep-wake cycle. In humans, disrupted rhythms are associated with major chronic health conditions including heart disease, some cancers and dementia, and many aspects of our day-to-day function including mood, performance and pain perception.

This minisymposium will be at the intersection of physiology and mathematics as we explore recent developments in circadian and sleep modelling across different species. A multidisciplinary team of scientists will present experimental data and mathematical models, highlighting the symbiotic nature of the two approaches. Mathematical models will range from conceptual phase models to large-scale simulations to investigate the internal mechanisms of circadian rhythms and their external interactions. In addition, recent mathematical methods to determine circadian time will also be presented. This minisymposium aims to deepen our understanding of circadian rhythms from the molecular level to their influence on human health and policy.
