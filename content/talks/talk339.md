## Abstract

An asymptotic procedure based upon the two-scale expansion method is proposed for homogenization of wave equations in quasiperiodic inhomogeneous media. Partial differential operators (gradient, divergence and curl) acting on periodic functions with m variables in a higher-dimensional space are projected onto operators acting on quasiperiodic functions with n variables in the physical space (m>n). We replace heterogeneous quasicrystals (coined irrational electromagnetic metamaterials in the context of light waves)  by effective media   described by  anisotropic tensors  of   permittivity  and  permeability, deduced  from  the resolution  of annex problems  of electrostatic  type on a periodic cell in higher dimensional space. The main assumption being that the wavelength is much larger than the period of the higher dimensional unit cell. 
We  derive in a heuristic way the homogenized Maxwell  system via easily implementable two-scale asymptotic expansions, but two-scale cut-and-projection convergence can be applied to rigorously establish our asymptotic results. We point out that the two-scale cut-and-projection method can be applied to any physical problems in quasiperiodic structures governed by systems of linear partial differential equations. Our asymptotic procedure has been successfully applied also to irrational acoustic and mechanical metamaterials.
