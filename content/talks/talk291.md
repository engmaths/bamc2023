## Abstract

Since their development, many mathematical models have been used to study the dynamics of infectious disease spread. Many of these consider a uniform population without demography. However, it is well documented that infectious diseases often affect individuals differently depending on age. In addition, vaccination for infectious diseases is frequently given to specific age groups, for example infants, instead of the entire population. To model these considerations, the population is partitioned into several age groups, which each have different disease parameters, and processes such as birth and death can be considered. Doing this allows us to analyse the role of population dynamics and demography in infectious disease spread.
