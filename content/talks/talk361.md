# Considerations for informing Test, Trace and support to Isolate (TTI) intervention design following the experience of COVID-19

**Elizabeth Fearon**

11:50 Monday in 2Q50/51.

Part of the *[How to be better prepared for a future pandemic: lessons learned from COVID-19, mpox and the four historic influenza pandemics]({{< relref "/sessions/session04" >}})* session.

## Abstract

Testing, contact tracing, and support to enable case isolation and quarantine of exposed contacts (TTI) is a key set of interventions used to control infectious disease transmission and was employed to reduce transmission of COVID-19 in the UK from 2020 through 2022, with some guidance still in place. Mathematical modelling, alongside other disciplines, has been used to inform emerging questions as to the likely effectiveness of TTI, its deployment alongside other control interventions and its optimal design. This talk will review the types of TTI questions that emerged, and tools that were used to answer these questions, highlighting key learnings to support  us in ensuring that we will be able to develop effective TTI strategies for future emerging epidemics. Examples will include analyses of transmission dynamics and timing and implications for tracing, alternatives to quarantine, and assessment of testing technologies and their different applications.
