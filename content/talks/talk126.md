## Abstract

Lithium ion batteries are manufactured by coating an electrode slurry onto a long thin metallic film (the current collector). After drying the slurry, the electrode/film construct is compressed between two metal rollers, which act to improve electrical contact between the metallic film and the electrode. This process is called calendaring and can have the unfortunate consequence of causing wave-like ripples in the electrode that, in turn, can lead to tearing of the electrode as it passes along the production line. Since each production run might produce several kilometres of electrode at a cost of over Â£50,000 understanding what causes the instability, which leads to rippling of the electrode film, and how it can be controlled is an important problem. We analyse this process by applying the Linear Plate Theory approximation of solid mechanics.
