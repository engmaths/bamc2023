## Abstract

In vertebrate embryos, the morphogen Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) patterns the neural tube, which then develops into the brain and spinal cord of the organism. Shh forms a gradient from the front to the back of the tube and its level determines neural identity of cells in the tissue; the cells interpret this signal to form sharply delineated domains of neural progenitors. For decades, scientists have been trying to understand how such precise patterning is possible. In general, trying to understand how one cell knows what to become has been one of the main goals in developmental biology. If we had to give the shortest answer to that question, it would be: ‘Information’. Shh sends the positional information to a cell through its pathway and the cell receives that information in the form of Gli activity and uses it to decide what genes to activate and which one of the neural progenitor domains it belongs to, leading to the precise pattern of different cell types along the tube. Since the fate of a cell in the neural tube depends on its position, we are interested in understanding how the cells distinguish different positions based on the information they receive. For this reason, we turn to information theory (IT) which was created to analyse communication over any noisy channel and uses mathematical language to describe the relationships between the sent message and the received one. IT defines the measures of information as functions of the input and output probability distributions that need to be modelled from data. Moreover, using these probability models and estimation methods, like maximum likelihood estimation, we try to estimate the position of a cell based on the output and compare it to the actual one. The results show interesting new features of the patterning and explain better how positional information is transmitted to the cells over time. In general, understanding how information is processed in cells can be essential for not only the study of embryo development, but also for the treatment of many diseases.
