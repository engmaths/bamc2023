# Effects of gravity and dispersive waves in chiral elastic systems

**Alessio Kandiah, Ian S Jones, Natasha V Movchan, Alexander B Movchan**

Tuesday at 11:50 AM in 4Q05.

Part of the *[Multiple wave scattering]({{< relref "/sessions/session29" >}})* session.

## Abstract

In this talk, we discuss new work on the wave motion of gyroscopic periodic systems subjected to gravity. In particular, we present the Floquet-Bloch analysis for waves within a gyroscopic chain. Green's matrices are constructed for the regimes of propagating modes and wave localisation. Our discussion is focused on the interaction between the chirality and gravity of the multi-scale system. The generalisations of the concepts presented in this talk are applicable to a broad variety of physical problems involving chiral lattice systems.
