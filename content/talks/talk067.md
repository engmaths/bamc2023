## Abstract

In recent years, classic evolution models have been extended to incorporate more realistic features. A recent series of papers have developed a new evolutionary framework including structure, multiplayer interactions, and movement. However, so far movement distributions have only involved independent movement e.g., without herding behaviour. In this presentation, we develop a model to investigate the evolution of such a population under movement distributions where individuals are influenced by the movement of others. The interactions between individuals are modelled using the multiplayer public goods game. By incorporating these new movement distributions into existing evolutionary models, we demonstrate that certain levels of aggregation benefit specific types of individuals. Moreover, by extending the home fidelity parameter which is the measure of preference individuals have for staying at their home vertex to any positive value, we investigate a general approach of novel models such as the wheel to a wider class of structures.
