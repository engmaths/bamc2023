# Full Waveform Inversion via Reduced Order Modeling

**Josselin Garnier, Liliana Borcea, Alexander Mamonov, Jorn Zimmerling**

Tuesday at 1:30 PM in 4Q05.

Part of the *[Multiple wave scattering]({{< relref "/sessions/session29" >}})* session.

## Abstract

Full waveform inversion (FWI) is a seismic imaging method that aims at using the entire content of seismic traces to extract physical parameters of the medium being probed by seismic waves. Conventional FWI is carried out by nonlinear least-squares data fitting with some appropriate regularization. It turns out that the FWI misfit function is high-dimensional and non-convex with many local minima. A novel approach to FWI based on a data driven reduced order model (ROM) of the wave equation operator is introduced and it is shown that the minimization of ROM misfit function performs much better. The talk is based on a joint work with L. Borcea (Univ. Michigan), A. Mamonov (Univ. Houston), J. Zimmerling (Uppsala Univ.).
