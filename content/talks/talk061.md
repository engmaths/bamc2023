Part of the *[Game theory and agent-based models]({{< relref "/sessions/session05" >}})* session.

## Abstract

Evolutionary game theory is an important tool to model animal and human behaviour. A key class
of games are the social dilemmas, where cooperation benefits the group but defection benefits
the individual within any group. Previous works have considered which games qualify as social
dilemmas, and different categories of dilemmas, but have generally concentrated on fixed sizes
of interacting groups. In this talk we discuss a systematic investigation of social dilemmas on all
group sizes. This allows for a richer definition of social dilemmas. For example, while increasing
a group size to include another defector is always bad for all existing group members, extra
cooperators can be good or bad, depending upon the particular dilemma and group size. We
consider a number of commonly used social dilemmas in this context, and in particular show the
effect of variability in group sizes for the example of a population comprising negative binomially
distributed group sizes. The most striking effect is that increasing the variability in group sizes for
non-threshold public goods games is favourable for the evolution of cooperation. The situation for
threshold public goods games and commons dilemmas is more complex.
