# Coupled sloshing and horizontal vessel motion with porous baffles

**Matthew Turner**

10:30 Wednesday in 3E11.

Part of the *[Applied fluid dynamics]({{< relref "/sessions/session46" >}})* session.

## Abstract

In this talk we consider two-dimensional coupled sloshing in a rectangular vessel. The vessel is free to move in one horizontal direction and is attached to a spring, which in turn is attached to a solid wall, and provides a restorative force. The vessel contains an inviscid, incompressible, irrotational fluid, and the interior of the vessel is divided into regions via infinitely thin porous baffles. The vessel is displaced, such that the spring extends, and then released from this position giving a coupled motion where the vessel motion induces the fluid to move, which in turn exerts a force on the vessel walls and baffles, causing the motion of the vessel to change. By considering linear motions we identify the modal structure of this system showing that the system contains neutral symmetric modes, where the vessel is at rest, and decaying antisymmetric modes which couple to the vessel motion.
