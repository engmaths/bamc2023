# A thin plate approximation for thick floating ice

**Luke Bennetts**

14:30 Monday in 2Q42.

Part of the *[Advances in water waves and free-surface flows]({{< relref "/sessions/session01" >}})* session.

## Abstract

I will present a Lagrangian formulation for ice (an elastic body) floating on water (a potential flow). I will then use the Lagrangian to derive a thin plate approximation, involving both flexural and longitudinal motions. For the problem of a semi-infinite ice cover, I will show that, in contrast to standard models, the ice and water motions are coupled at the ice edge. I will show how the coupling alters the predictions of the ice response to incident wave forcing over a range of frequencies.
