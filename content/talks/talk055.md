# Diffraction of acoustic waves by multiple semi-infinite arrays

**Matthew Nethercote, Anastasia Kisil, Raphael Assier**

Monday at 11:10 AM in 4Q05.

Part of the *[Acoustics]({{< relref "/sessions/session08" >}})* session.

## Abstract

This talk considers a multiple wave scattering problem with multiple independent semi-infinite periodic arrays of point scatterers. This generalises a recently published article where we considered two arrays arranged to form a wedge interface. The solution is obtained in terms of coupled systems of equations, one for each of the arrays. All of these systems are solved using the discrete Wiener--Hopf technique and the resulting matrix system can be solved by matrix inversion or by using an effective iterative numerical procedure. In the end, we can compute the interaction between thousands of scatterers from the multiple arrays. In particular, we will look at some special arrangements of arrays (including the wedge interface) and highlight the accuracy of the method by comparing with results from COMSOL.
