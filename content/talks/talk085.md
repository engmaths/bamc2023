# The inverse design of disordered metamaterials using the coupled dipole framework

**James Capers**

11:10 Wednesday in 4Q05.

Part of the *[Metamaterial modelling and design]({{< relref "/sessions/session50" >}})* session.

## Abstract

The ability to design the electromagnetic properties of materials to achieve any given wave scattering effect is key to many technologies, from communications to cloaking and biological imaging. Currently, common design methods either neglect degrees of freedom or are difficult to interpret. Here, we derive a simple and efficient method for designing waveâ€“shaping materials composed of dipole scatterers.  We demonstrate the versatility of our method by applying to many difference problems such as Purcell factor enhancement and the design of a multi-functional antenna.
