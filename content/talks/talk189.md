# Mathematical and Computational Ophthalmology: Coming of Age

**Paul A Roberts**

Monday at 2:10 PM in 4Q56.

Part of the *[Mathematical and computational ophthalmology]({{< relref "/sessions/session20" >}})* session.

## Abstract

This talk will set the scene for those which follow in the Mathematical and Computational Ophthalmology minisymposium. I will begin by defining what we mean by the terms Mathematical Ophthalmology (a new term which I have coined) and Computational Ophthalmology (an existing term) and how these fields relate both to each other and to more established experimental and clinical disciplines. I shall give a brief history of these emerging fields, highlighting key case studies, and discuss their future prospects. I will also be announcing and inviting participation in a number of exciting opportunities and initiatives aimed at promoting these fields and supporting those working within them.
