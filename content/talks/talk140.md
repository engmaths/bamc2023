## Abstract

The stability of immiscible two-fluid Couette flows is considered when slip is present
at the liquidâ€“liquid interface. The phenomena are modelled by incorporating a Navier
slip condition at the interface to replace that of no slip. A nonlinear asymptotic theory
is developed when the flow geometry consists of a thin layer slipping over a thick fluid
layer that scales with the channel height. A nonlocal, nonlinear evolution equation is
derived that is valid at finite Reynolds numbers, slip lengths, viscosity and density ratios.
The nonlocal term arises from the coupling between the phases and its Fourier symbol
is calculated in closed form in terms of Airy functions, thus generalising past results by
the inclusion of slip. The linear spectrum is calculated and it is shown that in geometries
containing a thin layer, the role of slip is to introduce dispersion and reduce instability
or enhance stability.
