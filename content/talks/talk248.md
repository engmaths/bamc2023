## Abstract

Support for the breast during exercise is essential (Brown et al, 2014). Various versions of this support have existed since the 19th century (Lesher, 1859). These all exist to hold or compress the breast during movement to reduce or control movement with varying degrees of subjective success for females. Majority of females have expressed various issues with support garments during a number of studies (Bowles et al, 2012; Brown et al, 2021)

The development of support garments has historically been guided through subjective work with participants. The use of objective measures is beginning to emerge and increase the knowledge of breast motion using low resolution measurement (Scurr, 2011). An understanding of the spatial and temporal kinematics of the breast in high resolution is required to improve support garments. A new method is in development that seeks to enable spatial and temporal surface movement measurement at high resolution.

Through the use of stereoscopic digital image correlation, the movement of X,000 points on the surface of the skin can be monitored. When reconstructed on the torso derivations can be made of shape change, surface strain and time resolved displacement at high resolution.

Initial results reveal considerable differences in breast motion between women based on factors including breast size, movement type and speed of movement. It is anticipated that this information will be of value to garment designers seeking to improve performance of their products and allow more women to participate in physical activity with greater levels of safety and comfort.
