## Abstract

Our research examines how the dynamics of vaccine beliefs, as a social
contagion, affects the population composition and, in turn, how this affects
an outbreak spread. The decision to become vaccinated is influenced by
exposure to information from external sources (such as health services,
the media and social connections). That information can be negative or
positive in regard to vaccination. Once someone adopts an opinion about
vaccination, they can begin to influence the people in their contact
networks, with potential for a social contagion that spreads through their
networks.
We investigate the possibility of mitigating negative social contagion by
applying an effective counter campaign that promotes vaccine uptake. If
negative vaccine-related information arises from random general
exposures and starts spreading among individuals affecting their
willingness to be vaccinated, having a positive counter campaign can alter
the spread of anti-vaccine opinion and lead to a better distribution of
vaccine uptake, which will ultimately suppress the epidemic.
In this study, we suggest and investigate several strategies for
disseminating positive vaccine-related information to find efficient models
that would successfully mitigate the impact of negative information and,
thus, encourage vaccination. These include choosing targets (i.e., a set of
individuals) at random or selecting them based on the local presence of
negative information, in both cases either with or without dynamic updating
of those targets. We demonstrate that working randomly to spread positive
vaccine-related information could worsen the situation by encouraging a
greater growth of anti-vaccine communities and, as a result, accelerating
the spread of the outbreak once it emerges in one of these communities.
However, targeted campaigns that take into account the presence of
negative sentiment in a community do better, with varying degrees of
epidemic suppression.
