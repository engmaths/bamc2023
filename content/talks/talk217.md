## Abstract

Bacteria can be free-floating or adhering to a surface, producing biofilm communities. Biofilm formation is
a multi-stage dynamical process with initial attachment of the proliferative bacteria, production of an extra
polymeric substance (EPS) that helps to stabilize the biofilm, maturation where we see interchange between
different bacterial phenotypes such as proliferative, persister and finally due to various reasons we get dead
bacteria which for some time can act as a nutrient source, and possibly, detachment. The majority of natural
settings contain biofilms made up of different species, whereas single-species biofilms are much less prevalent and typically only occur in specialized infection sites, including the surfaces of medical implants. Implant infection
is a serious clinical problem, with treatment usually involving systemic delivery of antibiotics. However, due
to the ability of bacteria within biofilms to survive antibiotic dosages that would ordinarily kill free-swimming
proliferative bacteria, biofilm infections are extremely difficult to eradicate. Antibiotic resistance and tolerance
confound the problem, often associated with nutrient insufficiency, hypoxia in the deeper layers of biofilm
and antibiotic concentration at levels above the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC). An alternative
approach is to delivery antibiotics locally in a sustained manner. In this study, we present a mathematical
model of biofilm growth subject to antibiotic delivery, with the aim of understanding how the biofilm growth
and composition depends on the drug dose and release rate.
We have formulated a 1D biofilm growth model in which we introduce controlled antibiotic release directly
from the implant. Infection can take hold if the antibiotic release is insufficient to stop bacterial growth, but
excessive drug release could hinder the healing of healthy tissue around the implant. This is an example of a
delicate balance that can be investigated and optimized by mathematical modelling. A more effective biofilm
prevention technique might be achieved by modelling the growth of the biofilm while concurrently optimizing
the antibiotic dose and release rate. The model consists of different bacterial phenotypes, self-produced extra
cellular polymeric substance (EPS), nutrient concentration, water volume fraction in the biofilm pores, growth
of the biofilm and a porous implant filled with antibiotic. We gained a better knowledge of drug delivery
for the prevention of infection through the simulation of the two moving boundaries in the model, which
were the drug level inside the implantâ€™s pores and the thickness of the biofilm, respectively. Additionally, we
have run simulations to see how certain model factors, such as nutrient content, affect the development of
various bacterial phenotypes. The composition and time-course of biofilm formation are impacted by various
antibiotic-release techniques from the nanoporous implant. This model takes into account both natural and
antibiotic-induced mortality of living organisms. As would be predicted, the density of proliferating bacteria
reduces with increasing antibiotic dose and increases as one moves away from the implant, where the antibiotic
is being supplied from. Since the proliferative bacteria undergo a phenotypic change into the persister bacteria
in order to survive the antibiotic dosage, persister bacteria, one of the primary causes of antibiotic resilience,
rises with increasing antibiotic dose.
As the thickness of the biofilm and the number of proliferating bacteria cells decrease with increasing antibiotic
dosage, our model shows that carefully regulating the antibiotic release could aid in preventing biofilm growth
for implant-associated infection. The model is able to depict experimentally observed resilience to antibiotic
shown by persister cells. Our next step would be to identify the best antibiotic administration arrangement
so that the infection and persister.
