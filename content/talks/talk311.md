## Abstract

Arterial blood clotting (thrombosis) is facilitated by the blood protein Von Willebrand Factor (VWF). At pathologically high shear rates, such as occur in coronary heart disease, VWF unfolds exposing platelet binding sites and allowing a blood clot to form rapidly.

We present a mechanistic continuum model for VWF behaviour in blood flow derived from a modified viscoelastic fluid model; our model uses a single constitutive equation to describe VWFâ€™s ability to extend as a function of the shear rate. We use this model to predict the protein's behaviour in simple flows, reproducing the known behaviour of the protein to unfold at a lower shear rate in elongational flow compared to shear flow. We then use the model to examine the behaviour of VWF in the complex flow structures which occur in pathological arteries.
