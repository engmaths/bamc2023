## Abstract

	 We consider a triangular lattice  of particles, each connected to their six nearest neighbours by nonlinear springs and subject to an additional onsite potential.  We use small amplitude asymptotic analysis to describe the motion of nodes within the plane of the lattice $u_{m,n}(t),v_{m,n}(t)$. Thus, we have a fully two dimensional (2D) Hamiltonian $H(u_{m,n},v_{m,n})$. We illustrate suitable form for the onsite potential $V_0(u_{m,n},v_{m,n})$.    
The system's linear frequency spectrum is composed of two branches.  An asymptotic reduction of this Klein-Gordon system using $u_{m,n} \sim \varepsilon e^{ikm+i \sqrt{3}ln} F\left( \varepsilon (m-Ut),\varepsilon (\sqrt{3}n-Vt) , \varepsilon^2 t \right), v_{m,n} \sim \varepsilon e^{ikm+i \sqrt{3}ln} P\left( \varepsilon (m-Ut),\varepsilon (\sqrt{3}n-Vt) , \varepsilon^2 t \right) $  yields   a 2D  Nonlinear SchrÃ¶dinger (NLS) equation of the form $ i \Omega  F_{T}= D_{M} |F|^2F+D_{Z}\left( F_{ZZ}+\mathcal{E} F_{\xi\xi} \right) $.  Wavenumbers $(k,l)$ that satisfy the ellipticity constraint $\mathcal{E}(k,l)>0 $, and  the focusing condition $D_{M}D_{Z}>0$, are necessary for localised  solitary wave solutions exist.
