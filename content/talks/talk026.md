## Abstract

GnRH pulse generator is a key regulator of the reproductive function in mammals. The experimental studies suggest that the neural network in the posterodorsal subnucleus of the medial amygdala (MePD) plays an essential role in the modulation of these pulses. However, the exact neurochemical pathways that manage the regulatory function in the neural population remain to be fully elucidated. Using mathematical modelling we study a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) depicting the interactions of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate sub-populations in the MePD. The system is based on the Wilson-Cowan framework, depicting the evolution of excitatory and inhibitory activity of large-scale neural network. The original system was extended with a second inhibitory sub-population for the model to be representative of the MePD population. We conducted a bifurcation analysis on a key model parameters, identifying a range of dynamical behaviours and comparing the obtained results with the experimental findings in literature.
