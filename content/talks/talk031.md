## Abstract

Materials with negative Poissonâ€™s ratio, also known as auxetic materials, display exotic properties
such as expansion in all directions under uni-axial tension. For their unique properties, these
materials find a broad range of applications in robotic, structural, aerospace, and biomedical
engineering.
In this work we study the wrinkling behavior of thin and soft auxetic membranes, subjected
to edge tractions. We show that spatial inhomogeneities of the Young modulus and of the Poisson
ratio can be suitably tailored to produce non-trivial wrinkling patterns, with wrinkled regions that
can appear, broaden, merge and eventually disappear again, as the magnitude of applied tractions
is increased monotonically. To model wrinkling in a functionally graded membrane, we employ
the mathematically elegant and physically transparent tension field theory, an approximated
method that we implement in commercially available software.
Beyond unveiling the challenging technological potential to achieve non-standard wrinkling
on-demand in auxetic membranes, our study also confirms the potential of using tension field
theory to study analytically and numerically instabilities in functionally graded materials.
