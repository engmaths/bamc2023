## Abstract

Current understanding of arrhythmia mechanisms and design of anti-arrhythmic drug therapies hinges on the assumption that myocytes from the same region of a single heart have similar, if not identical, action potential waveforms and drug responses. On the contrary, recent experiments reveal significant heterogeneity in uncoupled healthy myocytes both from different hearts as well as from identical regions within a single heart. This contribution will present a methodology for quantifying the individual electrophysiological properties of large numbers of uncoupled cardiomyocytes under ion channel block in terms of the parameters values of a conceptual fast-slow model of electrical excitability. The approach is applied to a population of nearly 500 rabbit ventricular myocytes for which action potential duration (APD) before and after the application of the drug nifedipine was experimentally measured (Lachaud et al., 2022, Cardiovasc. Res.). The methodology is further used to (a) direct evaluation of conditions necessary to maintain fixed APD or âˆ† APD, (b) predictions of the proportion of cells remaining excitable after drug application, (c) predictions of stimulus period dependency and (d) predictions of dose-response curves, the latter being in agreement with additional experimental data.
