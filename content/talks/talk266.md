## Abstract

In order to slow the rapidly deteriorating climate crisis we need to drastically increase our use of cleaner,
more renewable energy sources. Given that renewable sources are often subject to seasonal variations, the
question of what to do with the excess energy has the potential to be answered by underground hydrogen
storage systems. The storage security of underground hydrogen is largely determined by the quality of the
dense porous-rock formation known as the caprock which sits on top of the storage site. To assess the potential
for leakage, theoretical models need to be developed which can propagate the uncertainty in the spatially
varying structure of the caprock (Ma et al., 2018) through to the macroscopic hydrogen transport dynamics.
Our approach is to model the transport of hydrogen in the caprock as a diffusion-uptake process with first-
order reaction kinetics and an oscillatory boundary condition to account for the seasonal variations. For the
case when the spatial variation in diffusivity is weak we quantify the spatio-temporal variations in hydrogen
distribution by modelling the diffusivity as a Gaussian random field with a squared exponential covariance
function. We use a Greenâ€™s function approach (Price et al., 2022) to derive a perturbative approximation for
the time-averaged variance in the 1D concentration profiles of hydrogen. This analytical approach allows a
more insightful investigation into the relationship between the parameters of the problem and the variance
in the concentration field than standard Monte-Carlo methods. Our results show that the uncertainty in the
concentration of hydrogen increases non-monotonically with the correlation length of the diffusivity fluctuations.
The peak variance in hydrogen concentration occurs when the correlation length is comparable to the steady-
state penetration depth of hydrogen into the caprock. The uncertainty also increases non-monotonically with
the ratio of the frequency of injection/withdrawal to the reaction rate and the analytical expression for the
variance can be used to find an optimal frequency which minimises the uncertainty.
