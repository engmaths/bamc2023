## Abstract

In developmental biology, one of the main interests is to gain insight on the mechanisms that characterise the differentiation process of cells as they evolve from young, unspecialised ones into mature and specialised. Gene expression plays a crucial role in this, determining the characteristics of the cell and ultimately its cell type. 

Our work is Â motivated by recent developments in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq), a technology able to record the whole transcriptome, i.e. tracking thousands of gene species at once. scRNAseq data represent partial noisy measurements over multiple time points (i.e. developmental days) with high-dimensional features (i.e. genes) on each cell unit. 

Our proposed approach involves modelling the transition between time points as as a series of conditional diffusion processes using a neural SDE. In particular, we learn the potential function, associated to the system, by using the energy score as objective loss function and show the performance in a few scenarios.
