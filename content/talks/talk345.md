# Practical application of quantitative systems toxicology models in drug development: learnings and case studies from the IMI2-tQST project

**Ciar√°n Fisher**

Monday at 2:10 PM in 2Q50/51.

Part of the *[Mathematical pharmacology]({{< relref "/sessions/session13" >}})* session.

## Abstract

Quantitative Systems Toxicology (QST) is an approach integrating experimental and computational methods to elucidate toxicity mechanisms and translate nonclinical safety findings to the clinic. The IMI2-translational Quantitative Systems Toxicology project was a five year public-private partnership with the aim of leveraging data on biological systems to support QST model development and establish case-studies across four target organs; liver, kidney, heart, and GI. This talk will provide an overview of the projects outcomes as well as the benefits, and challenges, of the application of QST in drug development.
