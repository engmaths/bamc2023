## Abstract

In this work, we investigate the mechanical properties of conceptual structural adhesive joints, in which the role of the adhesive is played by an architected interface. In contrast to isotropic and homogeneous interfaces, properties of architected interfaces are controlled by tailoring the microstructure. Therefore, we augment existing theoretical frameworks by providing efficient homogenised models based on Cosserat elasticity, which accounts for emerging micromechanical effects. By using such homogenisation procedures, we demonstrate how characteristic lengths govern the mode I fracture behavior of architected interfaces. It is revealed that interactions among lengths-scales originating from microstructure allow control of the characteristic fracture process zone size. The findings are compared against numerical simulations justifying the effectiveness of the method. The theoretical and numerical approaches are inter-winded, revealing a set of critical parameters that need to be considered when designing architected interfaces under failure loads.
