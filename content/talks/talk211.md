## Abstract

Sickle cell disease is a genetic blood disorder induced by the polymerisation of sickle haemoglobin (HbS) inside red blood cells (RBCs) in reduced oxygen tension. Polymerisation causes RBCs to become stiffer, increasing effective blood viscosity and contributing to occlusion of blood vessels. Recent experiments have revealed significant heterogeneity in RBC properties within blood samples from a single patient. To understand this, we present here a mathematical framework that links oxygen tension to HbS polymer concentration in deoxygenated RBCs. We validate our results against state-of-the-art measurements of HbS polymerisation in RBC populations.
