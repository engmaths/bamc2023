# Optimisation and control for nonlinear dynamics

**Susana Gomes, Dante Kalise**

Wednesday at 10:30 AM in 2Q48.

Part of the *[Optimisation and control for nonlinear dynamics]({{< relref "/sessions/session43" >}})* session.

## Abstract

Nonlinear dynamics are ubiquitous in mathematical modelling, arising in multi-agent systems, fluid flows, and underactuated robotics, among many others. The solution of optimisation and control problems constrained to nonlinear evolution equations poses both theoretical and computational challenges. This talk is an overview talk of current challenges and advances in this topic, introducing the topics that will be covered throughout the mini-symposium with the same title, thus focusing on recent results on the synthesis of control laws for nonlinear systems including stabilisation in fluid flow problems, optimal control of agent-based dynamics, and
data-driven approaches.
