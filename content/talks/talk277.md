# Stability in an active exclusion process

**James Mason, Maria Bruna, Rob L Jack, Clement Erignoux**

11:10 Wednesday in 4Q56.

Part of the *[Asymptotics in active matter]({{< relref "/sessions/session53" >}})* session.

## Abstract

We introduce a lattice gas model of active matter whose hydrodynamic description can be derived exactly. The macroscopic limit is an integro-differential equation for the density in phase space (positions and orientations) of the particles and includes nonlinearities in both the diffusive and advective components. Systems of active particles can undergo phase separation without any attractive interactions, a mechanism known as motility-induced phase separation (MIPS). We explore the onset of such a transition in the parameter space of occupied volume fraction and Peclet number via a linear stability analysis and numerical simulations.
