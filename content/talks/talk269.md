# Large deviations and optimal control in active fluids

**Robert Jack**

Monday at 3:50 PM in 2Q48.

Part of the *[Controlling active matter]({{< relref "/sessions/session12" >}})* session.

## Abstract

We discuss large deviations of time-integrated quantities in models of active fluids, and their connection to optimal-control problems for these systems.  We first show some numerical results for fluctuations (large deviations) of the entropy production rate in two-dimensional active systems [1]. These results will be complemented by analytical results for a one-dimensional active system, where we analyse large deviations around the hydrodynamic limit [2].
