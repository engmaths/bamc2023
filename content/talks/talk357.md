# Cybergenetics applications in mammalian cells: closing the loop on non-linear dynamics

**Lucia Marucci**

Monday at 3:30 PM in 2Q50/51.

Part of the *[Mathematical pharmacology]({{< relref "/sessions/session13" >}})* session.

## Abstract

Mathematical modelling is widely used in systems biology to get a quantitative understanding of cell physiology, to explain the emergence of complex spatiotemporal dynamics, and to predict how to revert undesired cell states in disease. Still, there are major challenges in the development of models for cellular processes, for example in terms of parameter identification and model selection. 
In this talk, I will present cybergenetics as an alternative approach to study and steer complex cellular dynamics; it leverages feedback control and can be adopted even when detailed mathematical models are not available. I will show results obtained with intracellular, external or multicellular controllers, and new applications of cybergenetics methodologies we are currently exploring: control-based analysis of gene networksâ€™ dynamics, stem cell culture protocol optimisation, and combination therapy design for cancer.  
Our tools and results should make the design and control of complex cellular phenotypes and biomedical applications a step closer.
