# On Ostrovsky-type models

**Karima Khusnutdinova, Matthew Tranter**

11:50 Monday in 2Q42.

Part of the *[Advances in water waves and free-surface flows]({{< relref "/sessions/session01" >}})* session.

## Abstract

Single and coupled Ostrovsky-type equations have been derived as reduced mathematical models describing nonlinear internal waves in a rotating ocean, as well as strain waves in bi-layers with an imperfect interface. I will discuss how one can by-pass the so-called "zero-mass" or "zero-mean" contradiction associated with the equations in the class of periodic functions on a finite interval for several cases of increasing complexity, and will discuss the typical dynamical behaviours described by the models [1,2].
