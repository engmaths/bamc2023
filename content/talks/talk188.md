## Abstract

When a solid body floats at the interface of a vibrating liquid bath, the relative motion between the object and interface generates outwardly propagating surface waves. It has recently been demonstrated that millimetric objects with fore-aft mass asymmetry generate an associated asymmetric wavefield and consequently self-propel in unidirectional motion. Harnessing this wave-powered mechanism of propulsion, we here demonstrate that chiral objects placed on a vibrating fluid interface are set into steady, yet reversible, rotation, with the angular speed and direction of rotation controlled by the interplay between object geometry and driving parameters. Scaling laws and a simplified model of the wavefield reveal the underlying physical mechanism of rotation, while collapsing experimental measurements of the angular velocity across parameters. Guided by this discovery, we design a floating body with an asymmetric mass distribution and chirality that can be remotely steered along two-dimensional trajectories via modulation of the driving frequency alone. This highly accessible and tunable macroscopic system demonstrates a new mechanism where geometry and fluid-mediated forces can be manipulated for directed propulsion and particle transport.
