## Abstract

Shape-changing stimuli-responsive hydrogels change their topology and material properties under variations of external stimuli e.g., pH and temperature. This functionality promises a multitude of advanced applications such as novel careers for targeted drug delivery.
Here, we present a hybrid numerical model and develop these shape-changing stimuli-responsive hydrogels. The numerical model relies on the combination of the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics method and Mass Spring Model for modelling hydrogels and their interactions with the surrounding fluidic environment. The proposed model is used to investigate the characteristics of such designs in microfluidic systems and their dynamics in response to temperature variations via developing heterogeneous designs. The computational technique is capable of capturing the development of both fluid and solid phase fronts during the course of hydrogel shrinkage, and resolves the local fluid-solid interactions between the loaded fluidic solution and the hydrogel pores.
