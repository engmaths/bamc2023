# Microrobotic Swimmer Motions-Three Linked Spheres at Low Reynolds Number

**Laila Elatrash**

Poster session



## Abstract

We consider a swimmer consisting of three spheres that can be linked by two arms whose lengths can change between two values.  Microrobotic motion for the connected three spheres are moving in the fluid with velocity V_j^([i]), where index i is the number of spheres and j stands for the components of the sphere velocity. Najafi and Golestanian (2004) have considered this problem at a low Reynolds number, but we give it in more detail.  first, we investigate the hydrodynamic interaction between the spheres and then use that to find the hydrodynamic Oseen tensor, and then we analysed and calculated the swimmer proposed by(Najafi & Golestanian, 2004).  finally, give an expression for the distance moved by the swimming microrobot.
