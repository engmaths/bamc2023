## Abstract

Calcium (Ca2+) signalling is one of the most important mechanisms of information propagation in the body. The coupling between Ca2+ signalling and mechanics plays a crucial role in fertilisation, embryogenesis, wound healing, and cancer. One of the most important stages of embryogenesis is neural tube closure (NTC), which is responsible for the formation of the neural tube, the structure that later develops into the central nervous system. NTC is driven, in part, by the complex interplay of Ca2+ signalling and mechanics through Apical Constriction (AC) and malformations like anencephaly and Spina Bifida can result when this coupling is disrupted. However, this mechanochemical coupling is poorly understood and few models are available. We have developed a novel cell-based mechanochemical model that integrates Ca2+ signalling into the vertex modelling framework. Using the vertex-based model (developed in Python), we investigate how the spatial and temporal patterning of Ca2+ can trigger changes in cell shape by regulating their mechanical properties, resulting in tissue deformation, and how this deformation in turn impacts the Ca2+ patterning. Crucially, the model reproduces key aspects of the NTC process â€“ asynchronous, cell-autonomous Ca2+ flashes precede pulsed contractions at the cell level and a monotonic reduction of the tissue area.
