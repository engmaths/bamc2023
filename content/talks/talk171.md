## Abstract

Mathematical modelling of soft solids is the main idea of my presentation. Here, we aim at deriving mathematical formulations to find nonlinear response of soft solids in the presence of magnetic field. In fact, surface instabilities, including creases, wrinkles, ridges, and folds, are frequently seen when elastic materials are subject to a sufficiently large compression. In addition to that, magnetic field, can undergo large deformations in soft elastomers. Developing nonlinear continuum theory of magnetomechanical for elastomers is the first challenge of us to the aim of finding the role of magnetic effect in large deformations of soft solids. Furthermore, our final aim is to study the post-bifurcation analysis of magneto-sensitive soft materials. Mainly, we try to study surface instability, bifurcation, as well as post-bifurcation analysis of magnetoelastic soft materials because of their vital role in modern engineering practical demands like robotics.
