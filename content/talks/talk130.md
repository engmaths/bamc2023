# Mathematical models of engine ice crystal icing

**Timothy Peters**

Tuesday at 10:50 AM in 4Q08.

Part of the *[Thin films and contact lines]({{< relref "/sessions/session31" >}})* session.

## Abstract

In the last decade, ice crystal accretion on the interior surfaces of aircraft engines has been studied. Existing knowledge on the mechanism of ice crystal build-up within the hot engine core is still limited, although some models have been recently developed. In this talk, we discuss the derivation and study of a multi-phase mathematical model of ice and water accretion over a flat plate, subject to a combination of flow and ice/water flux conditions above the plate. The spatial variation and movement of the initial water layer is modelled using thin-film equations, which are then coupled with a transient heat transfer model in order to determine the onset of ice formation. The effects of the moving- and non-uniform film shapes on the initial formation of the ice layer, are considered.
