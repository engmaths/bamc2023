## Abstract

In tissue engineering applications, bioreactor scaffolds provide structural support to the growing tissue. Typically, bioreactor scaffolds are designed to be porous to facilitate nutrient transport throughout the tissue construct. Motivated by a tendon tissue engineering scaffold, we present a multiscale model of a fibrous bioreactor scaffold. We will discuss the technical difficulties introduced when fluid-induced motion of the scaffold is taken into account, and how to treat this issue. Simple solutions to the macroscale, porous media model will be presented to illustrate how the model may be used to predict the microscale shear stress distribution across the bioreactor scaffold, a key consideration in tendon tissue engineering.
