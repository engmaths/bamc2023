# Model Reduction and Coarse-Graining of Complex Systems

**Hong Duong**

Tuesday at 11:30 AM in 4Q04.

Part of the *[Complex systems and control]({{< relref "/sessions/session28" >}})* session.

## Abstract

Complex systems in nature and in applications (such as molecular systems, crowd dynamics, swarming, opinion formation, just to name a few) are often described by systems of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and partial differential equations (PDEs). It is often analytically impossible or computationally prohibitively expensive to deal with the full models due to their high dimensionality (degrees of freedom, number of involved parameters, etc.). It is thus of great importance to approximate such large and complex systems by simpler and lower dimensional ones, while still preserving the essential information from the original model. This procedure is referred to as model reduction or coarse-graining in the literature. In this talk, I will present methods for qualitative and quantitative coarse-graining of several SDEs and PDEs, in the presence or absence of a scale-separation.
