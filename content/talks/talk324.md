## Abstract

The clinical research community has raised the alarm on the importance of studying the role of clearance in Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD). We heed this alarm by developing and analysing the first network reaction-diffusion dynamical system coupling clearance and AD progression. Our data-driven computational approach simulates 40 years of patient-data-informed, clearance-mediated AD progression in less than 14 seconds of computational time, which allows for safe, ethical, and cost-effective in-silico experimentation. Analytical insights, computational results on high-resolution brain graphs constructed from the patient data, and the application of state-of-the-art human clearance data demonstrate the connections between clearance and neurodegeneration. Our results suggest clearance deficits may play an important role in the onset and trajectory of Alzheimer's.
