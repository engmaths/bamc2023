## Abstract

Anthropogenic disturbances, particularly mass poisonings, have caused crashes in vulture populations in Africa and Asia. Vultures play a crucial role in scavenging communities as apex scavengers. Scavenging communities in turn are a key component of terrestrial ecosystems, ensuring that dead biomass is removed quickly and efficiently. Here, using an empirically parameterised mathematical model, we analyse the short and long-term behaviour of such communities. In particular we examine the dynamics of a depleted vulture population and how these dynamics influence the abundances of rival scavengers as well as the overall biomass removal rate of the ecosystem. Finally, using a combination of numerical and analytical techniques, we undertake a sensitivity analysis with a view to understanding how our findings can be transferred from our study system to other ecosystems.
