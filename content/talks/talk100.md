## Abstract

Wave physics frequently use analyses of infinite structures to make predictions about the behaviour of large but finite-sized systems. Developing the convergence theory required to support this deduction is a challenging mathematical problem. In this work, we show that defect modes in infinite systems of resonators have corresponding modes in finite systems which converge as the size of the system increases. We study the generalized capacitance matrix as a model for three-dimensional coupled resonators with long-range interactions and consider defect modes that are induced by compact perturbations. If such a mode exists, then there are elements of the discrete spectrum of the corresponding truncated finite system that converge to each element of the pure point spectrum. We show that the rate of convergence depends on the dimension of the lattice. When the dimension of the lattice is equal to that of the physical space, the convergence is exponential. Conversely, when the dimension of the lattice is less than that of the physical space, the convergence is only algebraic, thanks to long-range interactions arising due to coupling with the far field.
