## Abstract

Cold rolling is a metal forming process where a strip of metal passes between two rollers and comes out
thinner. Understanding the stress and strain in the material resulting from the roll pressure is essential
not only for process design but also for material design. Established mathematical models for rolling make
unjustified adhoc assumptions (for example, assuming the deformation is vertically homogeneous), and are
not well validated due to a lack of reliable experimental or numerical data. Here, we present a multiple-scale
asymptotic model for cold rolling under the assumption of large rollers and a thin sheet. This model can
successfully predict the stress and strain distribution, including through-thickness stress oscillations, and is
shown to agree well with Finite Element simulations. The results also suggest a possible origin of residual
stress in the resulting strip. This modelling approach has potential applications in many metal forming
processes due to its accuracy, simplicity and quick computation.
