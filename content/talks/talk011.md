# Nonlinear acoustics in a general 3D duct

**Freddie Jensen, Ed Brambley**

Monday at 11:50 AM in 4Q05.

Part of the *[Acoustics]({{< relref "/sessions/session08" >}})* session.

## Abstract

The aim of this project is to reproduce and build upon the work of McTavish,
J. P. (2019) in modelling nonlinear sound propagation in 3D waveguides, with
an application to the harmonic series of brass instruments. Time-harmonic perturbations
about a state of rest are considered up to second order (weak nonlinearity).
The governing equations for weakly nonlinear sound are then projected
onto a basis of straight, cylindrical duct modes before the consideration of the
duct outlet physics. Eventually the impedance along the duct is calculated for
various geometries and endpoint conditions; this can be informative as to the
harmonic series of a brass instrument, for example.
