## Abstract

The Proper Generalised Decomposition (PGD) is a numerical method for solving differential equations based on a dynamic construction of the basis functions.  This is achieved by computing a separated series approximation of the solution using successive enrichments of the basis. The PGD algorithm is combined with least-squares methods, where the approximate solution is defined to be the minimizer of an appropriate least-squares functional. The minimisation problem is solved directly rather than the mathematically equivalent Euler-Lagrange equations. An optimal least-squares formulation that satisfies ADN theory is used. The discretization is based on the spectral element method which combines the generality of finite element methods with the accuracy of spectral methods, allowing us to obtain approximations that are extremely accurate due to the use of high-order basis functions. Numerical results are presented for elliptic systems which demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of this approach.
