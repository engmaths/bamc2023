# Mathematical modelling and optimization of photonic metamaterials

**Benjamin Vial**

15:30 Monday in 4Q04.

Part of the *[Numerical methods]({{< relref "/sessions/session16" >}})* session.

## Abstract

I will present the development of numerical methods for the resolution of Maxwellâ€™s equations implemented using open source libraries. All of them are endowed with automatic differentiation capabilities and typical inverse design examples using topology optimization will be presented.
