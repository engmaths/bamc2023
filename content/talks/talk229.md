# A computational model of the freezing of salt water 

**Brian Wetton**

Tuesday at 2:50 PM in 2Q42.

Part of the *[Sea ice modelling]({{< relref "/sessions/session33" >}})* session.

## Abstract

A numerical method is presented for a reduced model of the freezing of salt water. The method is a grid capturing method, an Enthalpy-type method with the added complexity of salt diffusion. Simulation results show the presence of two moving boundaries, one of which changes from explicit to implicit type. The work is motivated by the study of sea ice formation.
