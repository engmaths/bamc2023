# The role of enclosed population in an epidemic 

**Thomas Finnie**

12:10 Monday in 2Q50/51.

Part of the *[How to be better prepared for a future pandemic: lessons learned from COVID-19, mpox and the four historic influenza pandemics]({{< relref "/sessions/session04" >}})* session.

## Abstract

Enclosed populations have individuals who have greater interaction between members of the population than with members outside the population. These kinds of population occur nested within our wider society in the form of institutions such as care-homes, prisons, and military establishments and in stand-alone populations found in situations such as islands or ships. In this talk I will explore, using data and statistical and mechanistic models, how enclosed populations are affected by epidemics of respiratory viruses.
