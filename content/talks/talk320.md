# Field Theories of Branching in Cell Populations, Epidemiology and Neuronal Signals

**Johannes Pausch**

14:30 Tuesday in 4Q56.

Part of the *[New mathematical approaches in the life sciences]({{< relref "/sessions/session41" >}})* session.

## Abstract

Path integral methods can be used for stochastic modelling of many biological processes and they are particularly well suited for systems close to critical points. In my talk, I will highlight their applications to agent-based cell populations, epidemiology and neuronal signal propagation and show that external drivers such as additional noise or deterministic variations can lead to fundamental changes of the critical behaviour.
