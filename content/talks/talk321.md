# Ship wave patterns on floating ice sheets

**Emilian Parau**

14:50 Monday in 2Q42.

Part of the *[Advances in water waves and free-surface flows]({{< relref "/sessions/session01" >}})* session.

## Abstract

We explore the response of a floating ice sheet to a load moving in a straight and a curved path. We investigate the effect of turning on the wave patterns and strain distribution, and explore scenarios where turning increases the wave amplitude and strain in the ice, possibly leading to crack formation, fracturing and eventual ice failure.  The results were obtained in collaboration with Kristoffer Johnsen, Henrik Kalisch from University of Bergen, Norway.
