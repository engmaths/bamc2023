## Abstract

On surfaces with many cilia, individual cilia coordinate their beat cycles in the form of metachronal waves. The coordinated beating facilitates self-propulsion of ciliated microorganisms and creates efficient fluid flow, which is important in several human organs. Here, we consider the connection between single cilium characteristics and the collective behaviour. A theoretical framework is presented using an array of model cilia coordinated by hydrodynamic interactions. We calculate the dispersion relation for metachronal waves and perform a linear stability analysis to identify stable waves. This framework shows how the wave vector, frequency and stability depend on the geometric properties of cilia in the array and the beat pattern of an individual cilium. Analytical results are compared with agent-based numerical simulations of hydrodynamically coupled cilia, and we find quantitative agreement with analytical predictions. These results show how information about individual cilia can be used to predict the collective behaviour of many cilia.
