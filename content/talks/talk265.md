# Fourier analysis of Turing patterns

**Valentina Bucur**

Part of the *[Biofilms and pattern formation]({{< relref "/sessions/session37" >}})* session.

## Abstract

In this work, we study spatio-temporal patterns formed by motile bacteria which chemotactically move in response to the chemical they produce. Standard linear analysis can identify conditions when Turing patterns form and indicate the most unstable mode, however it gives no information about amplitude of spikes. We apply Fourier analysis to our system to analyse profiles of spikes and to find their amplitude and wavelength. We present numerical and analytical results to show the effectiveness of our method.
