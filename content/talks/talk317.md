## Abstract

In many physical and biological settings, slender elastic filaments (rods or ribbons) possess internal structure: the material or geometric properties of the filament vary significantly over its cross-section, or non-uniform residual stresses arise due to active processes such as thermal expansion, swelling, or growth. Just as one curls a ribbon of cloth by irreversibly stretching its outer layer over a sharp blade, such filaments can exhibit dramatic shape changes that may be central to their function. In general, predicting global behaviour from the internal structure is a challenging task, except in some special cases. For example, for a slender filament subject to small pre-stress, it is well known that the system can be modelled as an Euler-Bernoulli rod with effective natural curvature and twist.

Here, we study elastic ribbons subject to large, uniaxial pre-stress confined to a central region within the cross-section. We demonstrate that such ribbons can buckle spontaneously to form helicoidal-like shapes. This instability cannot be described by classical rod theory, which predicts zero spontaneous curvature and twist due to the mirror symmetry of the pre-stress. Using an energy relaxation method, we derive a one-dimensional ‘rod-like’ model from a nonlinear plate theory, which accounts for inhomogeneous pre-stress as well as finite rotations and extensibility of the mid-surface. We find that the model successfully captures the qualitative features of torsional buckling under a prescribed end-to-end displacement and rotation, and we demonstrate good quantitative agreement with the results of numerical (finite-element) simulations and experiments on elastomeric samples. More broadly, this system provides a macroscopic analogue of thermodynamic phase separation and pressure-volume-temperature state diagrams.
