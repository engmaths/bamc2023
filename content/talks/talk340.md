# Time-dependent problems in Wave Scattering

**Michael Meylan**

Tuesday at 12:10 PM in 4Q05.

Part of the *[Multiple wave scattering]({{< relref "/sessions/session29" >}})* session.

## Abstract

Generally, the frequency domain problem is the end goal of the solution of linear wave scattering problems. However, sometimes a time-domain solution is required. In this talk, I will discuss how this frequency domain solution connects to the resolution of the time-dependent problem. I will discuss two ideas, the generalized eigenfunction method and the singularity expansion method and show how these naturally arise. I will illustrate the technique with simple examples and discuss the general results.
