# Lane Nucleation in Active Flows

**Tim Rogers, Karol Bacik, Bogdan Bacik**

10:50 Tuesday in 3Q16.

Part of the *[Collective behaviour and transport]({{< relref "/sessions/session26" >}})* session.

## Abstract

Did you pass through King's Cross station on your way to BAMC 2023? If so, you may have experienced a puzzling kind of pedestrian flow as people leaving the station meet at right angles with a cross-stream of others trying to board trains. In this talk I will tell the story of a new hydrodynamic theory of pedestrian motion that predicts the dynamic patterns emerging in this situation, and in several other interesting scenarios. Along the way you will hear about conic sections, ultraviolet catastrophes, and conference attendees who need the toilet.
