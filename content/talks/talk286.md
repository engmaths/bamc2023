## Abstract

Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a genetic disease which causes red blood cells (RBCs) to become rigid and misshapen. This in turn contributes to blood vessels being blocked (vaso-occlusion). Recently, significant heterogeneity has been observed in the properties of RBC populations from patients with SCD. However, it is not known how this heterogeneity affects blood rheology and dynamics. Through computational blood flow simulations resolved at the cellular scale we investigate how different RBC property distributions lead to rheological properties and flow profiles. Furthermore we discuss the underlying mechanisms that may be causing these rheological differences. Our results contribute to our understanding of how heterogeneity in RBC properties contribute to physiological outcomes in SCD.
