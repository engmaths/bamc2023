# Maths, sleep and policies for 21st century living

**Anne Skeldon**

12:10 Wednesday in 2Q42.

Part of the *[Mathematical modelling of sleep and circadian rhythms: from molecular mechanisms to policy]({{< relref "/sessions/session42" >}})* session.

## Abstract

 On a day-to-day level, loss of sleep affects nearly every aspect of how we think or feel. For example, those who are sleep deprived have more accidents in the workplace, have slower reaction times, are less able to fight off infection, are more inclined to eat energy-dense foods and do less well in exams. Heart disease, dementia, obesity, mental health disorders are all associated with poor or mistimed sleep, with increasing evidence that the associations are bi-directional so sleep is not only a bi-product of poor health but also a causative factor. Altogether, a recent RAND report estimated that loss of sleep costs the UK Â£50 billion (1.86% of GDP).

So how can mathematics help? In this talk I will highlight two areas in which mathematical modelling of sleep and circadian rhythms could have policy implications for how we manage our work schedules and design healthy living environments for our 21st century society.
