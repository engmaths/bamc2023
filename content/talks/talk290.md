## Abstract

The effective reproduction number R has been widely accepted as an indicator for the status
of the COVID-19 epidemic. In the UK, the R value published on the UK Government
Dashboard has been generated as a combined value from an ensemble of fourteen epidemiological
models via a collaborative initiative between academia and government. In this talk we
outline this collaborative modelling approach and illustrate how, by using an established combination
method, a combined R estimate can be generated from an ensemble of epidemiological
models. We show that this R is robust to different model weighting methods and ensemble size,
and that using heterogeneous data sources for validation increases its robustness and reduces
the biases and limitations associated with a single source of data. We also show that R is
correlated with the rate of change in COVID-19 cases, hospital admissions and deaths, albeit
with a delay, suggesting R can be good indicator of future epidemic trends and a proxy for
epidemic status.
