# Using elastic waves to predict forces in thick-walled cylinder with application to roller-bearings

Part of the *[Multiple wave scattering]({{< relref "/sessions/session29" >}})* session.

## Abstract

The correct distribution of forces in a rolling element bearings is essential for a long life. We develop a method to monitor these forces by measuring elastic vibrations. In mathematical terms, by measuring displacement and traction on the outside wall of a thick-walled cylinder we can predict the traction on the inside wall. We show how to deal with sparse data by introducing restricting force distributions based on wind turbine bearings.
