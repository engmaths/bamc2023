# Matched asymptotics, conformal capacity, and applications

**Hiroyuki Miyoshi, Darren G Crowdy**

11:50 Tuesday in 2Q49.

Part of the *[IMA Lighthill-Thwaites prize]({{< relref "/sessions/session23" >}})* session.

## Abstract

Conformal capacity is a mathematical quantity relevant to a wide range of physical and mathematical
problems and there has been a recent resurgence of interest in devising new methods for its computation. 
In this talk we will show how ideas from matched asymptotics can be used to derive explicit estimates
for conformal capacity. The formulas derived here are explicit, and evidence is given that they provide
excellent approximations to the exact capacity values even well outside the expected range of validity.
