# Numerical study of Navier-Stokes flows in the whole space

**Koji Ohkitani**

14:10 Monday in 4Q04.

Part of the *[Numerical methods]({{< relref "/sessions/session16" >}})* session.

## Abstract

A majority of numerical experiments of the Navier-Stokes equations, lacking     
physical boundaries, have been conducted under periodic boundary conditions.    
In this talk, in order to access the effect of periodicity upon the flow        
properties, specifically we take up two-dimensional incompressible flows and    
carry out numerical simulations in the whole  plane to compare with those       
under periodic boundaries. We solve the Navier-Stokes equations on a square     
region using a finite-difference scheme. After checking the time evolution of   
the Oseen vortex with the exact solution, we simulate merging of like-signed    
vortices to compare with that under periodic boundaries. We are particularly    
interested in the decay law of the total enstrophy and spatial patterns.        
Time permitting, we mention results from three-dimensional computations.
