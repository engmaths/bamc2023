## Abstract

Microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, have recently been found to play key roles in neuronal development. However, the processes that drive the maturation of microglia functions remain comparatively unknown. We address this knowledge gap by developing a data-inspired mathematical model for mouse microglia population dynamics. We apply Bayesian inference and techniques from model selection to fit and evaluate several different mathematical frameworks to experimental data. The framework that best explains the available data occurs when microglia are heterogenous, transitioning from a highly proliferative phenotype to more of a quiescent population following birth. The predictions obtained by the fitted model motivate new biological experiments that confirm the existence of such proliferative heterogeneity, and demonstrates the benefits of synergistic collaboration between experimentalists and theoreticians.
