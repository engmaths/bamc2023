# Viral geometry as a key to understanding viral infections

**Reidun Twarock**

Tuesday at 2:50 PM in 4Q56.

Part of the *[New mathematical approaches in the life sciences]({{< relref "/sessions/session41" >}})* session.

## Abstract

Insights into the geometric principles underpinning viral particles provide a key to uncovering the mechanisms by which viruses replicate and infect their hosts. Using novel geometric and topological descriptors of virus architecture in combination with stochastic simulations, I will demonstrate how viral geometry impacts on different aspects of a viral life cycle, including virus assembly and genome release. These results pave the way to innovation in antiviral therapy and virus nanotechnology.
