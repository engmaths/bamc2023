## Abstract

Hollow vortices are regions of constant pressure with finite circulation embedded into an otherwise irrotational flow. We show quite generally that configurations of hollow vortices which steadily translate or rotate – sometimes called ‘H-states’ – can be rigorously constructed by desingularizing analogous configurations of point vortices. While the resulting solutions are not given explicitly, we provide the leading-order terms in an asymptotic expansion. Using global bifurcation theory, we then go on to describe how these curves of solutions can be extended until a singularity is encountered. As applications, we give what appear to be the first rigorous existence results for rotating hollow vortex pairs and for stationary hollow vortex tripoles.
