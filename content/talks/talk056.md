# Diffraction by a finite barrier/crack on a square lattice: an iterative Wiener-Hopf method approach

Part of the *[Multiple wave scattering]({{< relref "/sessions/session29" >}})* session.

## Abstract

Diffraction of a time-harmonic plane wave on various finite defects in a square lattice will be studied.  This problem is reduced to a matrix Wiener-Hopf equation with exponential factors. There is no known exact solution method for these types of equations. This work aims to adapt the recently developed iterative Wiener-Hopf method to this situation. Previously it has only been applied to Wiener-Hopf equations that arise in a continuous medium setting.
