## Abstract

Legged robots are required to be compliant to handle
perturbations, such as impulsive contact forces from differ-
ent terrains, or from other obstacles. In that respect, mod-
elling system dynamics using active control becomes chal-
lenging due to uncertainty and with parameters changing
over time due to operational and environmental conditions.
Biological systems use an inter-play of active control and
using the body as a computing resource to adapt to such
changing environment. Designing legged robots using such
an inter-play remains under-explored [1]. This paper, as part
of wider research on designing more adaptive robots using
this inter-play, demonstrates the quantification of the extent
of such embodiment using Bayesian theory and Kulback divergence method, which can be used as a useful input in
the design process.
