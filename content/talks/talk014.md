# Beyond Slender-body theory 

**Lyndon Koens**

Wednesday at 12:10 PM in 4Q56.

Part of the *[Asymptotics in active matter]({{< relref "/sessions/session53" >}})* session.

## Abstract

Fibres play a key role in the behaviour of active matter but are hard to simulate. Asymptotic theories, called slender-body theories, are effective but apply in specific regimes and can be hard to extend beyond leading order. In this presentation we briefly introduce one of the most common slender-body theories, outlining the strengths and weakness, before discussing an extension call Tubular-body theory which allows for the traction on these bodies to be found exactly.
