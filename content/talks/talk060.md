## Abstract

The phenomena of mixed convection is widely employed in a variety of engineering processes such as  the operation of solar collectors, heat exchangers, drying technologies, home ventilation, high-performance building insulation and lubrication technologies. Mixed convection is more difficult than other types of convection because of the interaction between the buoyancy force which caused by temperature difference and the shear force which caused by wall movement. Due to their low thermal conductivity, conventional heat-transfer fluids adopted in cooling systems such as water, oil, and silicone have limitations in their efficacy. There has been investigation on the possibility of using nanofluids in heat-transfer systems as a replacement for conventional fluids. In this work, a nanofluid was used to explore the heat transfer in an enclosed cavity. The nanofluid was water as the base fluid and aluminium oxide nanoparticles dispersed in it. This work considers the flow in a single and double lid-driven cavity.  The impact of different viscosity models on the mixed convection heat transfer is examined in this numerical investigation.  Numerical methods were used to obtain the solutions in parameter ranges where others have had difficulties, such as very large Rayleigh numbers.
