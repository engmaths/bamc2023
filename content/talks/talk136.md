# On scattering of nonlinear waves in a perfectly/imperfectly bonded elastic bar with delamination

**Jagdeep Tamber**

14:30 Monday in 4Q05.

Part of the *[Solid mechanics]({{< relref "/sessions/session17" >}})* session.

## Abstract

In this talk I will discuss the scattering of long longitudinal bulk strain waves propagating within a two-layered waveguide with a delamination ‘sandwiched’ between either soft (imperfect) or perfect bonding. This structure is modelled by a system of Boussinesq-type equations. We will implement direct numerical modelling and a semi-analytical approach, which is based on constructing a weakly-nonlinear solution. In the case of perfect bonding, we see solitons in the bonded section which fission in the delaminated region. For soft bonding, we see a radiating solitary wave is formed, which evolves into a soliton and dispersive radiation in the delaminated region. There is excellent agreement between the two numerical schemes in both cases. From these simulations we will analyse the amplitude in the final bonded region for various configurations of the structure and vary the delamination length in increments of Full Width Half Magnitude (FWHM) to see if we can find a correlation between the delamination length and the wave amplitude, as well as using theoretical predictions. These results can provide a vital tool in detecting delamination and ensuring the integrity of structures.
