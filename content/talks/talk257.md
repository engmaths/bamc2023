## Abstract

Circadian rhythms, daily oscillations with ~24 hr periodicity due to the
Earthâ€™s rotation on its own axis, have evolved in species across the
kingdoms of life, They allow the timing of a large range of physiological,
metabolic, and behavioral processes to anticipate environmental
cycles. Circadian timing in plants is governed by a clock gene network
that exists in each cell. This clock network consists of interlocked
feedback loops of transcriptional regulators Wheat is a key crop and
understanding the clock in wheat will have broader agriculture and
economical significance. However, the underlying clock mechanisms in
wheat are not well understood.

Utilising experimental datasets from wheat (Wittern et al. 2022), we built
models of the wheat clock to determine how it differs from the clock of
the well-studied plant Arabidopsis (Fogelmark et al. 2014, Caluwe et al.
2016). Our optimised models suggest a mechanism for the dawnexpression of the key clock gene ELF3 in wheat, which peaks at dusk in
Arabidopsis. Our unpublished finding involves using parameter
optimization methods to develop the first Ordinary Differential equation
model of the Wheat circadian clock.

Going forward, I will analyse new wheat RNA-seq time course data and
use machine learning techniques to develop a further optimised model
of the wheat clock network. In addition, we will investigate the effects of
temperature and noise in gene regulation on the clock and incorporate
yield related modules to explore chronoculture (Steed et al. 2021)
strategies.
