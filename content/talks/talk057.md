# Adaptive high gain lambda- tracking Luenberger observers

## Abstract

We develop an adaptive sampled-data Luenberger observer. Our motivation for sampling arises from the possibility that the output of a system may not be available continuously, but only at discrete time samples. Classical continuous-time Luenberger observers are used to reconstruct or estimate the state of a system through a stable observer. Our sampled data observer is developed using Euler numerical approximations of classical Luenberger observers with injections of sampled outputs. But in a sampling context, stability is lost if the sampling rate is not chosen carefully.
Therefore the output injection gain and the sampling rate are adapted. Under assumptions of relative degree one and minimum phase, we show that the adaptive Luenberger observer lambda-tracks the system state asymptotically, with convergent injection gain and sampling period. Lambda-tracking ensures that the error between the Luenberger state and the sampled true state converge to a lambda-ball. In our result, the sampling period h and injection gain g are such that g h ~ 1/{\log g}. We explore the application of this sampled-data Luenberger observer in a context of developing new numerical schemes that are driven by sampled observations.
