# Interfacial gravity waves and their limiting configurations

**Xin Guan, Jean-Marc Vanden-Broeck**

12:50 Monday in 2Q42.

Part of the *[Advances in water waves and free-surface flows]({{< relref "/sessions/session01" >}})* session.

## Abstract

It is well-known that two-dimensional periodic surface gravity waves have a limiting configuration characterized by a sharp 120-degree angle at their crests, known as the Stokes highest wave. However, periodic interfacial gravity waves between several homogeneous fluids exhibit more complex limiting configurations. In this talk, we present various numerical results of two-layer and three-layer interfacial waves based on a boundary integral formulation. With the help of a Fourier series method, high numerical accuracy can be achieved. Using this numerical scheme, we demonstrate fruitful new results on the limiting configurations and bifurcation structures of interfacial waves.
