# Wave Scattering from Layers of Random Particulate Materials

**Paulo Sergio Piva, Kevish K Napal, Artur L Gower**

13:50 Tuesday in 4Q05.

Part of the *[Multiple wave scattering]({{< relref "/sessions/session29" >}})* session.

## Abstract

To characterise any material with sound waves, the wave will propagate through several layers before reaching the material. If that material is a random particulate material, then to date there is no simple model to deal with the layers. In this talk we show how extending the quasi-crystalline approximation (a technique from statistical physics) to layers leads to clear and simple models which separate the influence of the microstructure from the material geometry.
