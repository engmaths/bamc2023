# Depthwise dependence in the slowing behaviour of debris flows

**Daniel Mckinnell, Chris Johnson, Nico Gray**

10:50 Wednesday in 4Q07.

Part of the *[Granular and multiphase flows]({{< relref "/sessions/session51" >}})* session.

## Abstract

Debris flows occur when particles of rock surrounded by water flow
downhill. These flows originate on steep mountainous slopes but flow
onto the shallower slopes of valley floors. High fluid pressures support
much of the solid weight, which decreases friction and prolongs the
flow, compared to flows without interstitial fluid. As the fluid
pressure dissipates, the material deposits from the base up. Previous
continuum models have taken a depth averaged approach which simplifies
the problem but makes assumptions about velocity and pressure profiles
in the depthwise direction, and is unable to describe the gradual
deposition of material. We will present a 1-D model that includes
variation throughout the flow height, identify timescales present in
slowing and compare to previous depth averaged models.
