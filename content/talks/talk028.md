## Abstract

We analyse a multiphase, moving boundary model that describes tissue growth. We consider
the evolution of a motile, viscous cell phase and an inviscid extracellular liquid phase. The model
comprises two partial differential equations that govern the cell volume fraction and the cell velocity,
together with a moving boundary condition for the tissue edge. Numerical simulations of the model
indicate that patterned solutions can be obtained, which correspond to multiple regions of high cell
density separated by regions of low cell density. In other parameter regimes, solutions of the model
can develop into a forward- or backward-moving travelling wave, corresponding to tissue growth or
extinction, respectively. A stability analysis of these
travelling-wave solutions provides us with criteria for the occurrence of patterned solutions.
