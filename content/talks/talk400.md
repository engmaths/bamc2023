# Physiologically-Based Pharmacokinetic Modelling: The Double-Edged Sword of Complexity

**Aleksandra Kmieciak**

Monday at 3:10 PM in 2Q50/51.

Part of the *[Mathematical pharmacology]({{< relref "/sessions/session13" >}})* session.

## Abstract

Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling has become an integral part of model-informed drug development. PBPK models are an example of large-scale linear ordinary differential equation models, which, while mathematically quite straightforward, can be daunting to understand. Their scale may also give rise to issues with model identifiability, parameter estimation and model analysis techniques. In this talk, I will illustrate methods of extracting information from such models in clinically relevant applications with no or limited data, as well as how the complexity may be managed in practice. The first case study will address the immunological role of the spleen, an organ of particular importance in T cell immunology and immunotherapy drug development. I will present how a mathematical analysis of the model can help us to understand the main processes affecting the relationship between T cell distribution in the main organs of the body in situations where data is lacking altogether. The second case study will focus on a model describing the deposition and mechanism of action of monoclonal antibodies, administered via two different routes. As blood data would be the only type of data available in the clinic, I will describe how such models can be developed and used with very limited data available to facilitate consideration of efficacy- and safety-related problems.
