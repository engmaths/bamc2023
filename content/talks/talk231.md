## Abstract

We model the axisymmetric water waves within the scope of the 2D Boussinesq system. Results of direct numerical simulations for the problem are compared with the numerical and asymptotic results obtained using the cylindrical Korteweg - de Vries (cKdV) and extended cKdV equations derived from the 2D Boussinesq system. We show, in a case study, that using the extended cKdV equation provides greater agreement.
