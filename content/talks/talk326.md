## Abstract

Magnetic confinement fusion (MCF) aims to provide limitless clean energy in the future. The Low-to-High confinement (L-H) transition is an extremely important phenomenon in achieving this aim. The L-H transition is a novel phenomenon involving the sudden improvement in the plasma confinement when an input power threshold is reached. Notably, the transition is accompanied by the regulation between turbulence and sheared poloidal flows with certain causal relationship between this regulation and the L-H transition. Here, the poloidal flows can be decomposed into a mean component and a varying component, referred to as mean flows and zonal flows respectively. The qualitative behaviour of the L-H transition was previously predicted using a deterministic, prey-predator-type model for the amplitudes of turbulence, zonal flow shear, mean flow shear and the ion pressure gradient. 

In this talk, we present new results from the stochastic L-H transition model by extending [1] to include stochastic terms in the evolution equations for the turbulence, zonal flow shear and pressure gradient. The noise terms capture the effects of small-scale physics which are omitted in the deterministic model. We show how a time dependent probability density function (PDF) for the turbulence, zonal flow shear and pressure gradient evolves in time and provide new insight into the L-H transition that was impossible through the deterministic model. In particular, we show that the PDF is often strongly non-Gaussian and thus the mean value and other moments are of limited use. In addition, we also discuss the utility of information geometry and entropy-related measures (like entropy production) in elucidating dynamic hysteresis associated with the L-H transition and its backward, H-L transition.
