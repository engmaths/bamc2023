# How data-driven, mechanistic modelling is being used to support elimination of African sleeping sickness 

**Kat S Rock**

Tuesday at 2:10 PM in 2Q50/51.

Part of the *[Modelling and inference in public health]({{< relref "/sessions/session35" >}})* session.

## Abstract

African sleeping sickness is a vector-borne infection, transmitted by tsetse in Central and West Africa and is also known as human African trypanosomiasis (HAT). This virulent disease is now targeted for global elimination of transmission to humans by 2030 following two decades of successful decline in cases. However, our collective experience in attempting to achieve elimination or eradication of other infections warns us that the last mile is the hardest.

In this presentation I shall present work of the HAT modelling and economic predictions for policy (HAT MEPP) project, which focuses on using regional, longitudinal human case data to parameterise location-specific models and provide tailored recommendations for strategies aimed at elimination. I will overview how data from a variety of sources influences our modelling and health economic evaluations. I will demonstrate the HAT MEPP graphical user interface that was developed in collaborative with national programmes to support dissemination of modelling results in an accessible way for non-modellers and to aid in intervention planning.
