# Phase tracking by weight adaptation for coupled Kuramoto oscillators

**Faizah Alanazi**

Poster session



## Abstract

We consider synchronization between a pair of Kuramoto oscillators. One oscillator plays the role of a
training oscillator, the other a learning oscillator. Our main result is an adaptive strategy which tunes the
Kuramoto coupling strengths (weights) and the Kuramoto frequencies in the learning oscillator to achieve
tracking between the phases of the training and learning oscillators. Tracking is proved using a Lyapunov
stability approach. The adaptive strategy also guarantees partial convergence of the learning weights and
frequencies to those of the training oscillator. Partial convergence is characterised by linear dependence of the
phase differences of the states of the training oscillator. The results are illustrated by a 4-node oscillator with
a variety of clustering configurations (2+2, 3+1, etc).
