# Oblique projections for state estimation and state stabilization of parabolic-like systems

**Sergio S Rodrigues**

Wednesday at 12:10 PM in 2Q48.

Part of the *[Optimisation and control for nonlinear dynamics]({{< relref "/sessions/session43" >}})* session.

## Abstract

Recent results on feedback stabilization of semilinear parabolic-like systems are presented,  where the feedback control operator is based on appropriate oblique projections and involves a finite number of actuators only. Feedback control inputs depend on the state of the system, which is not entirely available in real world applications and must be estimated. Oblique projections based dynamic Luenberger-type observers are presented which provide us with an appropriate state estimate, constructed from the output of measurements obtained from a finite number of sensors only. Numerical results are presented showing the performances of the proposed feedback control and observer.
