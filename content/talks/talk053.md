## Abstract

Fluid in its turbulent state is one of the most complex interacting systems in physics, with an incredibly
large number of strongly and nonlinearly interacting degrees of freedom. This becomes different when scale
separation introduces coherent, long-lived structures into the fluid flow, which induces order and stability. We
look at turbulent atmospheres of Jovian planets whose flows lead to coherent large-scale jets that persist for
long times. These jets may be steady or transition between several meta-stable jet configurations which are
driven by turbulent fluctuations.  We exploit the time-scale separation property between these structures in the flow and obtain a much simpler deterministic system which allows us to analyse these meta-stable states, their basins of attraction, separating hypersurfaces and transition states.  This is all carried out to answer the main question of under what conditions, and from what mechanisms, as well as with what probability can the system transition? i.e. how likely is it that Jupiter loses one of its jets?
