## Enthalpy Methods for Moving Boundary Problems

*09:00--10:00 Wednesday 5 April 2023 in X block lecture theatres*

We present the well understood Stefan and Oxygen Depletion Problems as examples of explicit and implicit moving boundary value problems respectively. We show the different ways these problems can be analyzed and computed numerically with a focus on the Enthalpy Method (a grid capturing technique). Generalized problems are shown, including two phase flow in porous media and the formation of sea ice. Rigorous analysis of the problems and their numerical approximation is missing in many of these generalized problems. 

## Biography

Brian Wetton is a Professor in the Mathematics Department at the University of British Columbia. His awards include the 1992 NYU Kurt O. Friedrichs Prize, the 2000 Pacific Institute of Mathematical Sciences Industrial Outreach Prize, the 2008 UBC Alan Blizzard Award, and the 2010 CAIMS/MITACS Industrial Research Prize. The industrial mathematics awards were recognition of his leadership role in a fuel cell modelling project with Ballard Power Systems that had both industry and MITACS NCE funding. He was the director of the UBC Institute of Applied Mathematics (2013-2018). Mathematical modelling of electrochemical systems has been a major application of his modelling, asymptotic, and scientific computing skills: the expertise in this area has been applied to fuel cells, generalized dialysis devices, and currently Li-ion batteries.
