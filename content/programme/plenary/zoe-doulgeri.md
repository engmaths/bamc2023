## Shared control in physical human-robot interaction applications (Public lecture)

*17:30--18:30 Tuesday 4 April 2023 in [Priory Road lecture theatre](https://goo.gl/maps/5SGoSriCqjo7YinY7)*

Over the last decades industrial robots have been widely deployed in the manufacturing industry, relieving workers from repetitive, unhealthy or arduous jobs with their workspace being strictly separated from that of humans for safety. Collaborative robots is a new generation of industrial robots that can work along side and with humans as co-workers or assistants. These robots are expected to provide flexibility by extending robot applications beyond the isolated structured work cells.  Collaborative robots should provide assistance to humans by reducing their physical and/or cognitive load, while being safe during their co-existence and collaboration with humans. In this talk, we will present shared control applications for resolving the problem of intentional physical human-robot interaction. The presentation will focus on the use of shared control methods for facilitating the human towards the kinesthetic teaching of a task, co-manipulating objects and progressive automation.

## Biography

Zoe Doulgeri is a Professor of Robotics and Control of Manufacturing Systems and the director of the Automation and Robotics Lab of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (AUTH). She received the diploma of Electrical Engineering from AUTH and an M.Sc. (DIC) in Control Systems, an M.Sc.(DIC)in Social and Economic Aspects of Science and Technology in Industry and a Ph.D in Mechanical Engineering, from the Imperial College, London, UK. She teaches Control Systems and Robotics. She authored more than 150 publications in peer-reviewed international journals and conferences. She is an evaluator of EU research and innovation proposals in Horizon-Europe and a reviewer in the most important robotics journals and conferences. She served as associate editor in the Journal of Intelligent and Robotic systems and the IEEΕ Robotics and Automation Letters. She has participated in many robotics projects financed by the EU and the Greek government. She has been the coordinator of the recently completed H2020 “Collaborate” project. She is currently coordinating an H2020European research project and two national projects. Her current research interests include the topics of physical human robot interaction, robot teaching and learning by demonstration, bimanual mobile robots, object grasping and manipulation with analytical and data based learning methods and the control of uncertain robotic systems. She has been the representative of Greece in the European Control Association from 2016-2021. She is a senior member of the IEEE, the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society and the IEEE Control Systems Society.
